  <h2 class='c004'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Here follows the second volume of my <i>Auld
Lang Syne</i>. In some cases my recollections go
back very far, and, after a lapse of nearly seventy
years, they may not always be so fresh as they
ought to be. It is very strange, on looking back
to the various stations through which we have
passed in our journey through this life, to find how
much our own fate has depended on our surroundings
and on circumstances over which we ourselves
could not possibly have had any control. Our
friends, nay even our enemies, seem to form part of
our life, and thus it has come to pass that instead
of writing my own life, I have almost unconsciously
come to write about my friends rather than about
myself. As to enemies, if indeed I ever had any,
I prefer to be silent, for it is difficult to be quite
fair in speaking of them, and we seldom know, till
it is too late, what real benefactors they have been
to us. Scholars, who on questions of scholarship
differ from us as we differ from them, should never
be counted as personal enemies, if only they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>truthful and straightforward, and if otherwise, is it
not best here also to follow the old rule, <i>De mortuis
nihil nisi bonum</i>? But with regard to my friends
and acquaintances, the older I grow, the more I feel
how much I have owed and still owe to them, nay,
how often the whole stream of my life has been
turned East or West by a word or two spoken by
a friend at the right moment, just as a whole train
may be turned by the mere touch of a handle by
the pointsman.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first volume of my <i>Auld Lang Syne</i> contained
recollections of musicians, poets, crowned
heads, and beggars, such as had not entirely vanished
from the <i>camera obscura</i> of my memory.
The present volume is chiefly devoted to my <i>Indian
Friends</i>, and to certain events that first led my
attention to India. Though I have had but visions
of the rivers, the mountains, the valleys, the forests,
and the men and women of India, having never
been allowed to visit that earthly paradise, I have
known for many years the beauties of its literature,
the bold flights of its native philosophy, the fervid
devotion of its ancient religion, and these together
seem to me to give a much truer picture of what
India really was, and is still meant to be, in the
history of the world, than the Bazaars of Bombay,
or the Durbars of Râjahs and Mahârâjahs at Delhi.
Of course, I shall be told that my picture of India
is purely ideal, but an ideal portrait may sometimes
be truer than even a photograph, and, though I
trust that my facts on the whole are right, I shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>always feel most grateful, if any facts are pointed
out to me which either contradict or modify my
own judgments.</p>

<p class='c006'>India has never had full justice done to it, and
when I say this I think not only of ancient, but
of modern India also. And though it can easily
be seen that my chief interest lies with ancient
India, it should be remembered that in no other
country is the past still so visibly present as in
that southernmost home of the ancient family
of Aryan speech. There may be more historical
monuments, reminding us of the past, in Greece
and Italy. But life, with its religion, philosophy,
and literature, has completely changed there, and
we look in vain for a Socrates or Plato on the steps
of the Parthenon, or for a Cato or Caesar among
the lonely columns of the Forum. In India, on the
contrary, the religion of the Veda is by no means
entirely extinct. Not long ago even one of the old
magnificent Vedic sacrifices, the Agnish<i>t</i>oma, was
performed at Benares with all its pristine array.
The old epic poems are still recited by the Pâ<i>th</i>akas
of the country, and some of the old philosophies are
flourishing in native Colleges, such as Nuddea, so
that men of the present day, such as Gauri-<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>kara,
the Prime Minister of Bhavnagar, and the Yogin
Râmak<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a, bring back to us in full reality the
Rishis and Yogins of a thousand or two thousand
years ago.</p>

<p class='c006'>What seems to me to prevent a full appreciation
of the intellectual achievements of ancient and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>medieval India is that they are mostly looked upon,
as we look on the prodigies in our exhibitions, as
simply curious. Now, we should never say that
Plato and Aristotle were curious. We take them far
more seriously. We look upon them as our equals,
nay as our teachers. It cannot surely be the brown
skin that keeps us from feeling the same sympathy
and paying the same homage to the poets and
philosophers of ancient India, and that prevents even
at the present day any real friendship between the
best sons of India and England? That brown skin
may at first cause a feeling of strangeness, but I
know how easily that feeling can be and has been
overcome, and, judging from my own limited experience,
I can truly say that there is behind that warm
and almost Italian colour of the Âryas of India the
same warm heart, the same trust, and the same
love as under the white skin of Europeans. Real
friendship between the rulers and the ruled in India
ought to be no impossibility; it has existed again and
again; only it should no longer be the exception, but
the rule.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the account of my Indian Friends which I give
in this volume, should serve here and there to
overcome that feeling of strangeness and lead to
real trust between the two most distant members of
the noble family of Aryan speech, I should indeed
feel amply rewarded.</p>

<p class='c006'>I could not well pass over, as belonging by right
to the circle of my friends and acquaintances, the
ancient Rishis of the Veda, call them Dîrghatamas,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>Vasish<i>th</i>a, or any other name, and in order to show
what these ancient poets were really like, I have
ventured to add metrical translations of a few of
their hymns, celebrating the matutinal procession of
their bright Devas or gods. For these I have to
crave the indulgence of my critics. These poets
were the first to call me to India, and I have
never regretted having followed their call, as far as
other calls allowed me to do so. They have revealed
to me a whole world of thought of which no trace
existed anywhere else, and they have helped me to
throw the first faint rays of light and reason on
perhaps the darkest period in the history of religion,
philosophy, and mythology. That period, which I
should like to call the <i>Etymological</i>, will, I doubt
not, become illuminated hereafter by a flood of light
from the same source. The work of the present
generation of Vedic students could naturally be that
of pioneers only, but they may fairly say <i>In magnis
et voluisse sat est</i>, or in Sanskrit, Yatne k<i>ri</i>te yadi na
sidhyati, ko<span class='small'>z</span>tra dosha<i>h</i>!</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>MY INDIAN FRIENDS.<br> <br> I.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c011'>My first Acquaintance with India.</h3>

<p class='c012'>How I fell in love with India is a very old, and
a very long story. We have all read of young
knights who in a dream had a vision of a beautiful
princess, and who did not rest until they had found
her, delivered her, and, after many hard fights with
giants and monsters, carried her home in triumph.
I had such a vision of India when I was not yet
ten years old. It may seem passing strange that
a little boy in a small town of Germany should as
far back as 1833 have dreamt of India. Few
people would know that small town in which he
lived. However, if they will look on the map of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>Germany, somewhere between the 12th and 13th
degrees of longitude and the 51st and 52nd degrees
of latitude, they will find <i>Dessau</i>, the capital of the
Duchy of Anhalt. It lies on the road from Leipzig
to Magdeburg, and in these days of railways people
often pass it on their way to Berlin. I have never
been a very superstitious man, and have never
believed in ghosts or spirits, in table-turnings or
spirit-rappings, in visions or apparitions; in fact,
in anything that can strike the material senses, and
yet pretend to be immaterial, and has nothing to
strike with. This is the whole problem of ghosts
in a nutshell. If ghosts are immaterial, they cannot
strike our eyes, or tickle our ears. They could not
even have a sulphurous smell. If, on the contrary,
they are material, they are not ghosts. But this
by the way. But though an unbeliever in ghosts,
I have not been able to withhold my belief from
coincidences, strange coincidences, which we have to
accept in the course of our life without any attempt
to account for them. I well remember when I was at
school, one of my copybooks had a large picture of
Benares on the outside. It was a very rough picture,
but I can still see the men, women, and children as
they stepped down the ghats to bathe in the waters
of the Ganges. That picture caught my fancy and
set me dreaming. What did I know of India at
that time? Nothing but that the people were black,
that they burnt their widows, and that, in order
to get into Paradise, they had first to be mangled
under the wheels of the car of Juggernâth. On
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>my picture, however, they were represented looking
tall, and, as I thought, beautiful, certainly not like
niggers; and the mosques and temples visible on
the shores of the river impressed me as even more
beautiful and majestic than the churches and palaces
at Dessau. Boys will dream dreams, and as I was
sitting idle at school dreaming and seeing visions of
Benares, instead of doing my copy, I was suddenly
taken by the ear by our writing-master, and told
to copy several pages containing such names as
Benares, Ganges, India, and all the rest, because
I had been so idle and had made a very bad copy.
This was my first and somewhat painful acquaintance
with India, and it led to nothing else at the
time. It simply left the memory of a kind of
vision, and, if I had not later in life become devoted
to the reality of that vision, I should probably never
have thought of my copybook again.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—In Sanskrit words an italic <i>k</i> should be pronounced like
English “ch” in church, italic <i>g</i> like “j” in join. Thus, mle<i>kkh</i>a,
or, as some used to spell it, mlechchha, should be pronounced
like mlêcha. Proper names, however, and Oriental words that
have already a recognised spelling in English, have mostly been left
unchanged.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was when I had left school, and had gone to
the University of Leipzig in 1841, that my vision,
like a <i>revenant</i>, appeared again, and assumed then a
more tangible and permanent form. I was getting
a little tired of Greek and Latin, and the warmed-up
cabbage, the <i>crambe repetita</i>, of Homer and Horace,
when I heard of the foundation of a new Chair—a
Chair of Sanskrit—and saw lectures on Indian
literature advertised by Professor Brockhaus. Here
my curiosity was roused at once; I had already
had a slight flirtation with Arabic, but now I fell
seriously in love with Sanskrit, and became more
and more faithless to my first classical love. Professor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>Brockhaus was an excellent, kind-hearted,
and helpful teacher. I began Sanskrit with a will,
and, after I had attended his lectures for several
semesters at Leipzig, and had read with him such
ordinary books as Nala, Sakuntalâ, and even a
little of the Rig-Veda, I went to Berlin to study
under Bopp; and then proceeded to Paris, attracted
by the fame of Eugène Burnouf.</p>

<p class='c006'>At that time my desire to see India, as I had
seen it in the visions of my schooldays, became
very strong. As classical scholars yearn to see
Rome or Athens, I yearned to see Benares, and
to bathe in the sacred waters of the Ganges. But
at that time such a thing was simply out of the
question. At that time to go to India seemed to
be the privilege of Englishmen only, and it took
half a year to get there, and a great deal more
money than I could command. The dream of my
life to see India face to face has never been realised.
When I was young enough, I had not the wherewithal
to go there, and when, later in life, I was
invited again and again by my Indian friends to
go there, I was too old and too much tied down
by duties from which there was no escape. Besides,
unless I could have stayed in India at least two
or three years, could have learned to speak the
languages, and come to know the few native scholars
still left, it was nothing to me. My India was not
on the surface, but lay many centuries beneath it;
and as to paying a globe-trotter’s visit to Calcutta
and Bombay, I might as well walk through Oxford
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Street and Bond Street But, though I never stood
on the ghats of Benares, and never saw the men,
women, and children step down from them into the
sacred waters of the Ganges, I have had the good
fortune of knowing a number of Indians in Europe,
and no doubt some of the best and most distinguished
of the sons and daughters of India.
I have often been told that I have been misled
by these acquaintances, and have taken far too
favourable a view of the Indian character; that
I had seen the best of India only, but not the worst.
But where is the harm? I have seen what the
Indian character can be, I have learnt what it
ought to be, and I hope what it will be, and though
we cannot expect a whole nation of Rammohun
Roys, of Debendranâth Tagores, of Keshub Chunder
Sens, of Malabâris and Râmabâis, we ought not to
neglect them in our estimate of the capabilities of
a whole nation.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>Dvârkanâth Tagore.</h3>

<p class='c012'>Indians did not travel so freely fifty years ago
as they do now. The crossing of the black water
and all its consequences had not then lost its
terrors. When, therefore, in the year 1844, a real
Hindu made his appearance in Paris, his visit
created a great sensation, and filled me with a
strong desire to make his acquaintance. He was
a handsome man, and, as he took the best suite
of apartments in one of the best hotels in Paris,
he naturally roused considerable curiosity. I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>then attending Professor Burnouf’s lectures at the
<i>Collège de France</i>, and, as the Indian visitor had
brought letters of introduction to that great French
savant, I too was introduced to the Indian stranger,
and soon came to know him well. He was the
representative of one of the greatest and richest
families in India, Dvârkanâth Tagore, the father
of the Maharshi Debendranâth Tagore, who is still
alive, and the grandfather of Satyendranâth Tagore,
the first successful native candidate for the Indian
Civil Service, whom I knew as a young student in
England, and who now, after serving his country
and his Empress with great distinction for many
years, has retired from the service.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dvârkanâth Tagore was not a Sanskrit scholar,
but he was not unacquainted with Sanskrit literature.
The first time I saw him was at the <i>Institut
de France</i>, when Burnouf presented him with a copy
of his splendid edition of the Bhagavat-Purâ<i>n</i>a.
On one side was the Sanskrit text, on the other
the French translation, and it was curious to see
the Indian placing his delicate brown fingers on the
white page with the French translation, and saying
with a sigh, “Oh, if I could read that!” One
would have expected that his wish would have
been to understand the ancient language of his
own country; but no, he pined for a better knowledge
of French.</p>

<p class='c006'>He was not an antiquarian, nor a student of his
own religion or of the language of his own sacred
books. But when he was told by Burnouf what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>my plans were, and how I had actually copied and
collated the MSS. of the Veda at Paris, he took
a lively interest in me. He invited me, and
I often spent the mornings with him, talking
about India and Indian customs. Strange to say,
he was devotedly fond of music, and had acquired
a taste for Italian and French music. What he
liked was to have me to accompany him on the
pianoforte, and I soon found that he had not only
a good voice, but had been taught fairly well. So
we got on very well together. After complimenting
him on his taste for Italian music, I asked him one
morning to give me a specimen of real Indian
music. He sang first of all what is called Indian,
but is really Persian music, without any style or
character. This was not what I wanted, and
I asked whether he did not know some pieces of
real Indian music. He smiled and turned away.
“You would not appreciate it,” he said; but, as
I asked him again and again, he sat down to the
pianoforte, and, after striking a few notes, began to
play and sing. I confess I was somewhat taken
aback. I could discern neither melody, nor rhythm,
nor harmony in what he sang; but, when I told
him so, he shook his head and said: “You are all
alike; if anything seems strange to you and does
not please you at once, you turn away. When
I first heard Italian music, it was no music to me
at all; but I went on and on, till I began to like
it, or what you call understand it. It is the same
with everything else. You say our religion is no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>religion, our poetry no poetry, our philosophy no
philosophy. We try to understand and appreciate
whatever Europe has produced, but do not imagine
that therefore we despise what India has produced.
If you studied our music as we do yours, you would
find that there is melody, rhythm, and harmony in
it, quite as much as in yours. And if you would
study our poetry, our religion, and our philosophy,
you would find that we are not what you call
heathens or miscreants, but know as much of the
Unknowable as you do, and have seen perhaps
even deeper into it than you have!” He was not
far wrong.</p>

<p class='c006'>He became quite eloquent and excited, and to
pacify him I told him that I was quite aware that
India possessed a science of music, founded, as
far as I could see, on mathematics. I had
examined some Sanskrit MSS. on music, but
I confessed that I could not make head or tail
of them. I once consulted Professor H. H. Wilson
on the subject, who had spent many years in India
and was himself a musician. But he did not
encourage me. He told me that, while in India,
he had been to a native teacher of music who
professed to understand the old books. He had
expressed himself willing to teach him, on condition
that he would come to him two or three times
a week. Then at the end of half a year he would
be able to tell him whether he was fit to learn
music, whether he was in fact an Adhikârin, a fit
candidate, and in five years he promised him that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>he might master both the theory and the practice
of music. That was too much for an Indian
civilian who had his hands full of work, and
though he learnt many things from Pandits,
Professor H. H. Wilson, then, I believe, Master
of the Mint and holding several other appointments
besides, had to give up all idea of becoming
apprenticed for five years to a teacher of music.
Dvârkanâth Tagore was much amused, but he
quite admitted that five years was the shortest
time in which any man could hope thoroughly to
master the intricacies of ancient Hindu music, and
I too gave up in consequence all hope of ever
mastering such texts as the Sangîta-ratnâkara, the
Treasury of Symphony, and similar texts, though
they have often tempted my curiosity in the library
of the East India House.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is another member of the Tagore family,
Râjah Surindro Mohun Tagore, a very liberal
patron of Indian music, who has published a great
deal about it, but he too has kept aloof from
touching on the old science of music that once
existed in India, though we know as yet so little
of its literature. If we could accept a tradition
that has been repeated again and again by Sanskrit
scholars, even by men of great learning, such as
the late Professor Benfey, we should have to
believe that Guido d’Arezzo (about 1000 <span class='fss'>A. D.</span>)
borrowed his gamut from the Arabs, and that
they had adopted it from the Persians, who had
been the pupils of the Hindus. In itself such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>a borrowing has nothing incredible in it, for we
know that our figures, not excluding the nought,
travelled on the same road, from the Indians to
the Persians, the Arabs, the Spaniards, and the
Italians. It is true also that one of the Indian
gamuts consisted of seven notes, and that these
notes went by the names <i>sa</i>, <i>ri</i>, <i>ga</i>, <i>ma</i>, <i>pa</i>, <i>dha</i>, <i>ni</i>,
which were the first syllables of their Sanskrit
names. So far, therefore, there is some plausibility.
But if it is maintained that these seven syllables
were changed in Italian to the well-known <i>do</i>, <i>re</i>,
<i>mi</i>, <i>fa</i>, <i>sol</i>, <i>la</i>, <i>si</i>, we require some more of real
historical evidence of such a change before stating
as a fact what is, as yet, a guess only. Gladly as
I should claim any merit for the people of India,
it seems to me that the differences between the
names of the notes of the two gamuts are greater
than their similarities. All we can say is that it
is possible that we owe our gamut to India, but
until more evidence is produced, we cannot say
more. If we remember that we owe the nought
to that country, mathematicians will be ready to
confess that this was one of the greatest discoveries
in the history of mathematics and of all the sciences
that depend on mathematics, one of the greatest
benefits, in fact, that the East has conferred on
the West. Whether we owe to India Beethoven’s
symphonies is another question, that has yet to wait
for an answer.</p>

<p class='c006'>My Indian friend Dvârkanâth Tagore, though
not learned, was very intelligent, and a man of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>the world. He rather looked down on the
Brâhmans, and when I asked him whether he
would have to perform penance, or Prâya<i>sk</i>itta,
after his return to India, he laughed and said,
“No. I am all this time feeding a large number
of Brâhmans at home, and that is quite penance
enough!” The real penance was, of course, the
Pa<i>ñk</i>agavya, the five products of the cow which
the penitent had to swallow before he could be
readmitted to his caste; and these products were
not only milk, sour milk, and clarified butter, but
likewise other products, such as Mûtra and Gomaya.
That penance still exists, and many of our Indian
visitors have had to undergo it after their return,
though at present the five products of the cow are
reduced to infinitesimal proportions and swallowed
in the shape of a gilded pill.</p>

<p class='c006'>But if he took a low view of his Brâhmans, he
did not show much more respect for what he called
the black-coated English Brâhmans. Much as he
admired everything English, he had a mischievous
delight in finding out the weak points of English
society, and particularly of the English clergy.
He read a number of English newspapers, political
and ecclesiastic, and he kept a kind of black book
in which he carefully noted whatever did not
redound very much to the honour of any bishops,
priests, or deacons. It certainly was a curious
collection of every kind of ecclesiastical scandal,
and I have often wondered what could have
become of it. His son, the saint-like Debendranâth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Tagore, the head of the Ârya-Samâj, would hardly
make use of such weapons; but his father delighted
in the book, and brought it out whenever the
question turned on the respective merits of the
Indian and the Christian religions. All I could say
was that no religion should be judged by its clergy
only, whether in Italy, in England, or in India.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dvârkanâth Tagore lived in a truly magnificent
Oriental style while at Paris. The king, Louis
Philippe, received him, nay, he honoured him, if
I remember right, by his presence and that of
his Court at a grand evening party. The room
was hung with Indian shawls, then the height of
ambition of every French lady. And what was
their delight when the Indian Prince placed
a shawl on the shoulders of each lady as she left
the room!</p>

<p class='c006'>When in England, Dvârkanâth fulfilled a sacred
duty to the memory of Rammohun Roy, the great
religious reformer of India, by erecting a tomb
over his ashes in the cemetery at Bristol, little
thinking that he would soon share his fate, and
die like him in a foreign land.</p>

<p class='c006'>I believe it was his doing also that a new interest
was roused in India for the study of the Veda. It
was certainly a curious and anomalous state of things
that in a country where the Veda was recognised
as the highest authority in religion, invested with
all the authority of a divine revelation to a greater
degree even than the New Testament is in England,
this Bible of theirs should never have been printed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>and should have been accessible to a small class
of priests only, who knew it by heart and possessed
a few MSS. of it. Still, so it was; nay, so much
had the study of the Veda become neglected that
when a prize was offered by the late J. Muir to
any one who would undertake an edition of it, not
a single native scholar was willing or able to undertake
the task. When, therefore, Dvârkanâth saw
that I was quietly preparing an edition of the
most important, in fact, the only true Veda, the
Rig-Veda, and that I had copied and collated
the MSS. which existed in the Royal Libraries
at Paris, at Berlin, and elsewhere, and was going
to finish my collection in London, he seems to
have informed his son, Debendranâth Tagore,
of what I was doing at Paris, who, full of interest
for religion and religious reform, dispatched about
the same time four young native students to
Benares, in order to enable them to study the
Veda under the guidance of the Pandits of that
sacred city. One was to learn the Rig-Veda,
another the Sâma-Veda, a third the Ya<i>g</i>ur-Veda,
a fourth the Atharva-Veda. To judge, however,
from a letter of Debendranâth Tagore himself, this
may have been a mere coincidence. Unfortunately
not one of these young Pandits seems ever to
have done any independent work in the direction
suggested by Debendranâth Tagore.</p>

<p class='c006'>I may as well state here that I never claimed
nor received the very substantial prize offered by
J. Muir. Such vague and exaggerated accounts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>have been spread and even published as to the
magnificent <i>honorarium</i> paid to me by the late
East India Company that I may as well state
that, even if I could have carried through the
press one sheet per week, after copying, collating,
and adding all the references to Sâya<i>n</i>a’s commentary,
I should never have earned more than £200
a year for a work which during more than twenty
years of my life occupied nearly all my time. I do
not grudge that time, and I shall always feel
deeply grateful to some of the Directors of the
old Company for having taken so active an
interest in what seemed at the time a very useless
undertaking. I do not think that the financial
position of India has greatly suffered on account
of the printing of the Rig-Veda, nay, the expense
incurred for it must have been amply recovered,
considering how largely the six large quartos have
been used for presents to the Râjahs in India and
to the Universities and Museums in Europe. Of
course it is impossible to make presents without
having to pay for them. If people will invent
and exaggerate, I may as well tell them that
I believe the youngest clerk in the India Office
would have declined to work for twenty years at
such a salary as I did. And yet I was as happy
as a king all the time.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>Debendranâth Tagore.</h3>

<p class='c012'>Though I have never seen the son of Dvârkanâth,
Debendranâth Tagore, I have had several most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>interesting letters from him, and I have always
felt the deepest sympathy for his noble and
unselfish efforts to purify the religion of his
countrymen. He was the patron and friend of
Keshub Chunder Sen, and, though he was too
conservative to be able to follow his young friend
in all his reforms, his love for his enthusiastic
pupil never ceased. When Keshub Chunder Sen
had been forsaken by nearly all his friends, because
he allowed the marriage of his daughter with the
Mahârâjah of Kuch Behar, when she was a few
months under age, the old man remained true to
him to the last, and mourned over him at his deathbed
as a father would mourn over his only son.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here is at least one of Debendranâth Tagore’s
letters to me. I am always ashamed when I print
any letters from my Indian friends. They are far
too kind, far too complimentary. I know how to
make allowance for their warm heart and for their
exuberant language, but I am afraid that to people
unacquainted with Eastern skies and Eastern hearts,
it will naturally seem that such letters ought never
to have been published. But what gives so true a
picture of a man as a confidential letter?</p>

<p class='c016'>I was very glad to receive your letter. It will
always give me pleasure to hear from the Pandit
of the Far West who has done so much for the
language and literature of my country. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>are branches of knowledge and art in which the
East is deficient, and which she must learn from
foreign sources. But there are other things all
her own, and even your enlightened countrymen
may turn with pleasure and profit to a leaf or
two out of the books of the East to learn something
new, to get a glimpse of vistas of thought
with which they are not familiar. And you, Sir,
have done not a little to open out before the
world treasures of Oriental wisdom which only
the diligence of scholars like you could unfold.
By the publication of the Rig-Veda and the
Upanishads you have brought within the reach
of European scholars the thoughts and aspirations
of our ancient Rishis, hitherto hidden in inaccessible
manuscripts. And it is to be hoped that the dissemination
of the knowledge of our ancient literature
will help to cement the bonds of union
between the two peoples who, brought up under
a common roof, parted from each other and
scattered over distant quarters of the globe, again
to be brought together under the mysterious decree
of Almighty Providence.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You are perhaps not quite right in taking me
for a Sannyâsin in the sense of one who has wholly
renounced the world. To be in the world, but
not of it, is my <i>beau idéal</i> of a Sannyâsin, and in
that sense I am one. My sons are settled in life
and working before my eyes. I take a keen
interest in all that goes on far and near, in my
domestic circle and outside. My infirm health,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>however, does not permit me to take an active
part in the affairs of the world. So I have settled
down for the present in a country house by the
banks of the Ganges, far from the din and bustle
of the town, and yet not too far to be out of its
reach, and my life glides smoothly along like the
waves in winter, resigned to His will and ready
to quit its mortal coils at His call.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The schism in the Brahmo Samâj is a thing
to be regretted, perhaps it may do present harm
to the cause. We should have been stronger, if
united, but there is no cause for despondency.
The seeds have been sown, and they will bear
fruit in God’s own time. We are but humble
seekers of the Truth and humble workers in her
cause. We must work and labour each in his
own sphere and according to his own light, regardless
of consequences. The crowning and fruition
of our work rests with God alone, and we may
repose our trust in Him for success. Truth will
triumph in the end. Satyam eva <i>g</i>ayati.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Accept my best thanks for the copy of your
Biographical Essays you have so kindly presented
to me. It is a very interesting book, and I have
read it with the greatest delight. The charitable
feeling which you have shown in judging of
Keshub Chunder Sen is worthy of your liberality
of thought. I received no intimation from my
father regarding the publication of the Rig-Veda.
It was my own idea to send Pandits to Benares
to study the Vedas. The project entirely originated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>with me, and had no connection with the work you

<p class='c005'>Whatever may be thought by others of such
a letter, to me it seems a most instructive and
characteristic page in the recent history of India.
Let us think, first of all, whether there is a single
man living in Europe, a man of wealth and high
position in his own country, who could have
penned such a letter in a foreign language,
whether German or Sanskrit. There is hardly
a word in it that would have to be altered, and
as to the spirit pervading it, no bishop need be
ashamed of it. And yet how many people are
there even among members of the Indian Civil
Service, who would look upon this man as their
equal, not to say, as their better? What he says
about the new lessons which even we in England
might learn from India, more particularly from
the Rig-Veda and the Upanishads, is by no means
a mere phrase. He knew quite well what he
meant. He was quite sufficiently acquainted with
our language, our literature, our philosophy and
religion to have a right to say that there are
things in those books which are new to us, and
might be truly helpful to everybody who strives
to solve for himself the many riddles of this
world. Let us remember, first of all, that the
Rig-Veda is the oldest book of the world. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>older than anything in Greece and Rome, older,
as a book, than any book in China, older than
the old Persian Avesta, older than Buddhism and
its sacred canon, older also than the Old Testament.
I know that this last statement will make
many people shake their heads, as if the truth
and value of a book depended on its age. Is
the Old Testament truer than the New, because
it is older? Truth is neither young nor old, it
is eternal, and history teaches us that the older
a religion, the more has it been exposed to
deterioration in the hands of priests and no-priests.
Ancient ruins are, no doubt, venerable and impressive,
but for dwelling in them and for the daily
work of life new buildings are better.</p>

<p class='c006'>No one would say that because the Rig-Veda
is the oldest book of the human race—we cannot
call cuneiform or hieroglyphic inscriptions, however
large they are, books in the ordinary sense of the
word—it is therefore the best or the truest. It
is on the contrary a record of the childhood of
our race, full of childish things, but full also
of such unexpected sparks of thought as occasionally
startle us from the minds and mouths of
babes. The more childish the words of the Rig-Veda
are, the more instructive they should prove
to us. Where are we to study the origin of
religion of the Aryan race to which we ourselves
belong by language and thought, if not in the
Rig-Veda? Nor does it require much study.
Whoever runs may read it on every page. No
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>one doubts now that the gods of the ancient
Âryas were representatives of the great phenomena
of nature, conceived in the only way in which, in
the then state of language and thought, they could be
conceived, that is as active and personified. What
we should have anticipated, and what in fact was
anticipated by philosophers, was fully confirmed by
the hymns of the Rig-Veda, which were found to
be addressed to the Dawn, the first miracle and
the greatest revelation the world has ever seen,
though we have learnt to look upon the light of
the morning as a matter of course. They were
addressed to the morning Sun, the bringer of light
and life, to the blue Sky, the gatherer of clouds,
the giver of rain and fertility, to the Earth, the
Rivers, the Fire, the Storms, and many more.</p>

<p class='c006'>During the period reflected in the songs of the
Rig-Veda, the poets had already made the step
from the worship of many gods, the Devas, or
the Bright Ones, as they called them, to the
recognition of one, but still personal God above
all gods, nay, they had purified the concept of
that Supreme Being from all that was implied
in a male or female personality, and had acknowledged
it as neither of the one nor of the other
sex, as untrammelled by what personality means
with us, as the true, free, and eternal Godhead
of which the other gods were but human renderings
more or less perfect. We can watch in the
Rig-Veda how all these thoughts and conceptions
of the Deity arose naturally in the human heart,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>and there is no other literature in which the
genesis of the Divine in the human mind can be
so fully and so clearly watched and studied.
A record of this theogonic process is surely
worth having, and though it naturally holds true
of the Aryan race only, it is after all the race to
which we ourselves belong, not merely by blood
and bones, but, by what is far more important,
by language and thought. If we can observe
this theogonic process among other races also,
whether civilised or uncivilised, a comparison of
the different roads that led to God may become
most important. Care, however, must be taken
not to mix what is heterogeneous. The religions
of uncivilised races, whether ancient or modern, but
mostly modern, should be studied by themselves,
and of course by scholars only, or by those who
have at least a knowledge of the grammar of the
language in which the religious ideas of such races
lie embedded. A beginning in this direction has
been made, and much may be expected from ethnological
studies in the future. Hitherto they have
mostly proved amusing only, and without much
scientific value, for which the scarcity of materials
is answerable far more than the credulity of some
of our ethnological students. What is the true
value of the theogony of the Aryan race is its
historical character, and its continuity which enables
us to watch the growth of the concepts of the
gods and of God in an unbroken chain till we
arrive, chiefly in the Upanishads, at that true
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>conception of the Godhead, free from all limitations,
even from that of personality, in the human
sense of that word, a stage that had been reached
by Greek and Jewish thinkers at Alexandria in
the first centuries of Christianity, but was soon
afterwards hidden again in the clouds of theological
anthropomorphism.</p>

<p class='c006'>It makes no difference whether we ourselves
consider this religious development of Aryan
thought of the Godhead as true or mistaken. Its
real interest is that it has historical reality, and
that at all events we can learn lessons from it
which we can learn nowhere else. It was my
desire to gain a direct knowledge of what is
preserved in the Rig-Veda of the earliest religious
development of our race, and thus to fill a gap
which had been felt for many years and deplored
by all true scholars, that made me conceive the
idea of publishing the text and native commentary
of the Rig-Veda; a task not without its difficulties,
both scientific and material, for it would otherwise
have been undertaken long before.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have a letter dated August, 1845, now before me
from the late Professor Roth, the editor with Professor
Boehtlingk of our great Sanskrit Dictionary,
where he says, “It is a truly youthful boldness
to undertake an edition of the whole of Sâya<i>n</i>a’s
commentary by yourself alone,” and he proposes
that I should allow him, Dr. Trithen, Dr. Rieu
and others to take each a part of the work. In
some respects I am sorry now that I did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>accept this offer, for the Veda would have appeared
sooner. But there were difficulties in this combination,
as in most combinations, and being then
very youthful and bold, I took the whole work
on my own shoulders.</p>

<p class='c006'>But if my edition of the Rig-Veda helped to
usher in quite a new period in Sanskrit scholarship
in Europe, it naturally produced an even
greater commotion all over India. After all, it
was their Bible, and had never been published
before during the three or four thousand years
of its existence. Attempts were made in various
quarters to taboo it, as having been printed by
a Mle<i>kkh</i>a and with cow’s blood; but the book
proved itself too strong, it was indispensable,
and was soon accepted even by those who
at first had placed it under their interdict.
The late Dr. Haug sent me a full account of a
meeting held by the Brâhmans at Poonah, who,
though unwilling at first to touch the book, called
an assembly in which a man, not a Brâhman, read
out my edition, and all the Brâhmans corrected
whatever MSS. they possessed, according to the
text as settled in the distant University of Oxford.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>Râjah Râdhâkânta Deva.</h3>

<p class='c012'>This brought me into correspondence with many
of the leading men both among the conservative
and orthodox, and among the progressive and
enlightened party in India. At the head of the
conservative party stood then a well-known man,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Râjah Râdhâkânta Deva, a kind of Indian Lord
Shaftesbury. He had distinguished himself by
publishing a large thesaurus of the Sanskrit language
in seven large quarto volumes, called the <i>S</i>abdakalpa-druma,
the paradise-tree of words. I was
highly pleased when I received so valuable a present
from the Râjah, and deeply interested in a letter
which accompanied it. People in India, even intelligent
people, were evidently very much puzzled,
how a Mle<i>kkh</i>a, as they called all barbarians, or
all not twice-born men, could have got hold in the
libraries of Germany, France, and England of the
<i>disjecta membra</i> of their sacred book, how he could
have made it out, and actually corrected it. The
reforming party naturally rejoiced in the publication
of the Veda. But some even of the old orthodox
believers in the Veda were highly pleased when
I presented to them their venerable Bible. Strange
as it may seem to us, such is the power of a long-continued
tradition that even the more enlightened
among the Hindus, at least at the time of which
I am writing, had no kind of doubt as to the divine
origin of the Veda. They looked upon it not only
as a revelation granted to mankind thousands of
years ago, but they believed that it was premundane,
that it had existed in the mind of the
Supreme Being from all eternity, and had been
breathed forth before the beginning of the world.
They thought of it, not as a book, but as a revelation
handed down from teacher to pupil in an uninterrupted
succession. There existed manuscripts of it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>but not very many, and the only way recognised
in India of learning the Veda, without destroying
its sanctity and efficacy, was to learn it by heart
from the mouth of a qualified teacher. Every
word, every letter, every accent of the Veda had
been settled by authority as far back as about the
fifth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, and from that point of view the
authority of oral tradition was, and is still considered
much higher than that of a mere manuscript.
Formerly, as in the time of the Laws of Manu,
it was even forbidden to write the Veda or to sell
copies of it. That so sacred and more than sacred
a work should have been published for the first
time by a barbarian, and that hundreds of copies
of it should suddenly be for sale in the streets of
Benares, Bombay, and Poonah, was at first a very
great shock to the orthodox. Still, though there
were protests, and though all sorts of doubts were
thrown on the genuineness of the printed text, even
the most bigoted opponents of everything European
had at last to give in, and to confess that the printed
text was really their true Veda, and that it was
more complete and more correct than any manuscript
then in existence.</p>

<p class='c006'>We must never forget that the ancient literature
of India was entirely mnemonic. This may sound
almost incredible, yet there are few Sanskrit scholars
who would any longer doubt it. In their recognised
system of education the imprinting of the ancient
books on the memory of the young was the most
essential feature. Boys, not girls, had to spend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>years and years of their youth, while staying in the
house of a Guru, in learning by heart line after line
of certain books, and nothing else. Thus only can
we account for the wonderful capacity and tenacity
of their memory. They at first learnt their sacred
books, as I have known children to learn poems
in a foreign language, without even attempting to
understand a single word. Children of good
Brâhman families were simply treated like sheets
of paper, on which the teacher impressed letters,
syllables, words, and sentences by sound only. Later
only came the time for going over (Adhyayana) what
stood thus imprinted on their memory, and for
understanding, under the guidance of qualified
teachers, its real purport. This, too, may seem
almost incredible to us, but in the absence of
writing and printing, what else could have been
done? Every boy who passed through the orthodox
system of education (Brahma<i>k</i>aryâ) became a copy
of whatever text he was made to learn, and this
copy had to be kept in good condition by constant
repetition. Unless we keep this clearly before our
mind, we shall never understand the state of ancient
literature in India, with all its changes and chances,
before the introduction of writing. When we consider,
for instance, the enormous bulk of the ancient
Sanskrit epic, the Mahâbhârata, a poem of more
than 90,000 couplets, four volumes quarto, we hesitate
before accepting it as a mnemonic poem. And
yet we have what amounts to almost positive
evidence of the poem having existed before the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>introduction of writing into India, in the fact that
there is an episode, added at the beginning of the
poem, in which we are told how the whole poem was
reduced to writing by the god Ga<i>n</i>e<i>s</i>a, and that this
episode is absent in many MSS., particularly those
of the South of India. And even after the introduction
of writing every precaution was taken to keep
certain sacred texts from being written down, so as to
force each rising generation to learn their literature,
sacred and profane, from the mouth of a teacher,
and not from a manuscript. Even to the present day
this old system of imprinting whole books on the brain
has not been allowed to become entirely obsolete,
and the mnemonic achievements which in several
cases I have witnessed myself in young men when
they come to Oxford are almost unbelievable.</p>

<p class='c006'>A printed edition of their sacred Rig-Veda was
therefore, even under the changed circumstances
of the nineteenth century, a kind of monstrosity.
Among the first to recognise my edition of the
Rig-Veda was the Râjah Râdhâkânta Deva, and
his recognition was all the more important to me
as he stood at the head of the strictly orthodox
and conservative party in Bengal. He himself
had no doubt that the whole Veda was really
the eternal word of God, and that an unswerving
faith in it was the <i>sine quâ non</i> of a religious
and pious life. Even such highly esteemed books
as the Laws of Manu, the Mahâbhârata and the
Purâ<i>n</i>as had to give way before it, if there should
ever be any difference between them and the Veda.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>We can hardly imagine how people in India could
live in such an atmosphere, but it evidently agreed
both with those who thought for themselves and
with those who thought as they were bid.</p>

<p class='c006'>My friend, Râdhâdkânta, however, made some
reservations. The Rig-Veda, he said, though far
the most important, is only one out of four Vedas
which, though all founded on the Rig-Veda, have
each certain portions peculiar to themselves. This
no one would have denied, but what are the
hymns of all other so-called Vedas put together, if
compared with the Rig-Veda? They are mere
sacrificial prayer-books, most of their hymns being
taken from the Rig-Veda, and the Atharva-Veda
being confessedly a later collection, though it
contains curious remnants of Indian popular poetry,
incantations, medical formulas, and the like. If all
had been lost, except the Rig-Veda, the loss would
not have been very great, at least so far as the
study of ancient mythology and religion was concerned.
Of course I had studied the Ya<i>g</i>ur-Veda,
and had actually copied the whole of it with
Mahîdhara’s commentary at Paris. This was published
afterwards by Professor Weber from my own
copy which I had presented to him. I could also
tell my Indian friend that we possessed in Germany
an edition of the Sâma-Veda by Benfey, and were
expecting an edition of the Atharva-Veda by
Roth. These were editions of the hymns of the
four Vedas, but I could assure him that even
the Brâhma<i>n</i>as, on which he laid great stress as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>being the highest authorities for sacrificial rules,
for traditions, and ancient customs, were no longer
hidden from us, but ready to be published by
scholars such as Haug, Weber, Aufrecht, and
others. But even then he would still make his
reservations. We might know one <i>S</i>âkhâ, or text,
he said, of each of their sacred books; but, in
conformity with the highest theological authorities,
he maintained that there existed formerly many
more of such texts which had become extinct; but
which nevertheless must be admitted as the original
authority for any doctrines or customs not sanctioned
by the Vedas, such as we possess them now. The
first part of this argument I readily granted, but
I had to demur to the second, because anything,
even the most degrading customs, might thus have
been invested with a divine sanction.</p>

<p class='c006'>And so it was, as is well known by this time, in
the case of Sutti, or the burning of widows, a custom
which, though it had long ago been abolished by
law, gave rise to a long and animated controversy
between the old Râjah, Professor Wilson, and myself.</p>

<p class='c006'>To show what kind of man the Râjah was, I shall
here give some specimens of his letters. It is
difficult to do this, because, as I stated before, the
style adopted by Hindus in writing letters, whether
in Sanskrit or in English, is so flowery and ornate
that, particularly when it is addressed to oneself,
it seems very conceited and egotistical to publish
any of their laudatory remarks. Allowance must
be made for Oriental phraseology, and all superlative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>expressions have to be considerably reduced
in English before they reach the level of reality.</p>

<p class='c006'>In November, 1851, the Râjah, when sending me
his Thesaurus, wrote:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“When I ventured to assume the character of
a lexicographer, my most ambitious wish was but
to revive the study of Sanskrit in my own country,
where it has been on the decline; but I should
not dissemble that love of fame stimulated my
exertions through worldly tribulations, where
patience must have failed and perseverance wearied.
I devoted the greatest portion of my life and no
inconsiderable amount of labour and expense to
the execution of the work; and though as an
encyclopaedist I have no claim to originality, or
to the merits of genius, yet, I trust, my industry
and application will, at least, be applauded when
I may be considered as a humble pioneer of Sanskrit
learning. I have endeavoured to obtain the approbation
of those whose good opinion one cannot but
be proud of and solicitous to secure; nor is it an
inconsiderable reward of my labour that it has
deserved the commendation of a Müller and a
Wilson, who have won golden opinions by their
profound scholarship in Sanskrit.”</p>

<p class='c006'>To be named by the side of Wilson was a compliment
highly appreciated by a young man of
twenty-eight, as I then was, and I may be pardoned
for having felt flattered at the time more than was
perhaps quite right, by the old Râjah’s well-turned
phrases.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Then, turning to my edition of the Rig-Veda, my
correspondent continued:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have lately been honoured by the Honourable
the Court of Directors with the present of the first
volume of your noble and excellent edition of the
Rig-Veda, published under their patronage. Some
time ago when I received your specimen copy of it,
which you had so politely desired Dr. Roer to send
me, I read it with eagerness, and, although I was
obliged to return it sooner than I could have wished,
I saw enough to convince me that you would go
far beyond all expectation, and your present publication
has confirmed this opinion.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Arduous and novel as is the undertaking you
have entered on amidst a variety of disadvantages,
the able and masterly manner in which you have
begun to execute it displays your profound erudition,
critical acumen, and unparalleled industry of research;
you stand forth a very illustrious example of uncommon
ardour and undaunted perseverance, such
as is not to be cooled by discouragement, nor
obstructed by difficulty; your labours will furnish
the Vaidik Pandits with a complete collection of the
Holy Sanhitâs of the first Veda, only detached portions
of which are to be found in the possession of
a few of them, and enable the student of antiquity
‘to snatch the veil that hung her face before,’
supply materials for the history of the ancient
East—nay, ancient world, and rear up for you
a monument more durable than brass.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I confess I feel somewhat ashamed of copying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>this panegyric, but no one will suspect me of having
believed a word of it. It seemed to me, however,
that a letter so well conceived and so well expressed
was worthy of being preserved as showing a phase
through which the Indian mind had to pass, and
which by this time it has left behind. If we consider
how different the trend of native thought really
is from our own, we shall have to confess that few,
if any, European scholars have ever mastered any
Oriental language to the same extent as the writer
of this letter has mastered English, or have adapted
their thoughts so cleverly to English models as
this old Râjah.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let us see now how he arranged the facts of the
case, so as to satisfy his own mind:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is surely,” he continues, “a very curious reflection
on the vicissitudes of human affairs that the
descendants of the divine Rishis (prophets) should
be studying on the banks of the Bhâgîrathî (Ganges),
the Yamunâ (Jumna), and the Sindhu their Holy
Scriptures as published on the banks of the Thames
by one whom they regard as a distant Mlechchha,
and this Mlechchha, the descendant of the degraded
Kshattriyas (noblemen), according to our <i>S</i>âstras,
and claiming a cognate origin with the Hindus,
according to the investigations of the modern
philologists, who will ere long rise to the rank of
a Veda-Vyâsa (arranger and revealer of the Veda)
of the Kaliyuga.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Though our <i>S</i>âstra is deemed the grand and
primeval fountain from which the present streams
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>of knowledge that run through the civilised countries
of the globe have taken their rise, yet it has not
been considered as defiled by receiving into it a
foreign tributary. As Yavanâchârya (a Greek
teacher) gave to the Hindus his system of astronomy
many centuries ago, so the German Bha<i>tt</i>a
(Doctor) is now giving them his edition of the
Rig-Veda, and will, as he promises, furnish them
with his commentaries upon them.”</p>

<p class='c006'>If we wish to understand and to appreciate the
effort made by this highly educated Indian nobleman,
to digest what must have been a hard morsel
to his orthodox mind, the edition of his own sacred
book by a German or an Englishman, let us try
to imagine what it would have been to us if the
New Testament, never printed before, had been
published for the first time, not by a Dutch scholar,
such as Erasmus, but by a Hindu at Benares. We
know how great was the commotion when, after
the invention of printing, Erasmus published the
first critical edition of the New Testament. We
must not imagine that the feelings of awe and
reverence for their Veda were different from our
own for the Bible. To have this book, which few
only had ever seen before in India, sent to them
from London and offered for sale, proved indeed
a great shock to the Hindu conscience, nor was
it easy for many of their priests to take the same
dispassionate view as this enlightened Râjah. He
had by no means broken with his religious convictions
or national prejudices, and in his eyes, in spite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>of all his kindness and politeness, I was and could be
no more than a Mle<i>kkh</i>a, that is a barbarian. As
I had never been in India and could never, like so
many other scholars, have availed myself of the valuable
assistance of native Pandits, it seemed to him
impossible to account for my knowledge of Sanskrit,
particularly of the obscure and difficult Vedic
Sanskrit, unless he made me a descendant of certain
noble or Kshattriya families who, according to the
Purâ<i>n</i>as, had been exiled from India many centuries
ago. And, as if to quiet his own conscience in
accepting my edition of his sacred book as undefiled
by the foreign hands through which it had
passed, he reminded himself that after Alexander’s
conquests in India certain Greeks or Yavanas had
acted as teachers to the astronomers of India, and
had even been accepted as inspired, so long as they
taught what was true. All this shows a most
interesting crisis through which the Hindu mind
had passed in former times, and had to pass once
more, a crisis which, though it has not yet finished,
is at all events preparing a religious reformation in
India, by assigning to the Veda its true historical
position, as the best that the Hindu mind could
have produced four thousand years ago, and that
to the present day has retained a certain vitality
among the true leaders of the people of India.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have always been a bad correspondent, finding
it quite impossible even at that early time to answer
all the letters of my many unknown friends. India,
from a very early day in my career, has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>smothering me with letters, many of them in Sanskrit
or in local dialects which I do not even understand.
Now it seems that in this case also I waited
for some time before acknowledging so interesting
a letter as that of the Mahârâjah. However, I find
the draft of a letter to him among my papers, and
I may as well give an extract from it here:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“The letter which you addressed to me in 1851
on receiving the first volume of my edition of the
Rig-Veda reached me so late that I had nearly
finished the second volume of my Rig-Veda, and
I therefore postponed writing to you, because
I wished at the same time to send this my second
volume, if only to show you that I meant what
I said, and was determined to carry out my undertaking—namely,
to publish in time the whole collection
of the sacred hymns of your Rishis, together
with the commentary composed in the fourteenth
century by the learned Sâya<i>n</i>â<i>k</i>ârya. I have stated
in my Preface how much I owe to your valuable
Thesaurus, a work which will make your name
not only revered by your own countrymen, but
respected among all the scholars of Europe. Tathâ
<i>k</i>a <i>s</i>ruti<i>h</i>, Yâvad asmi<i>n</i> loke purusha<i>h</i> pu<i>n</i>yena
karma<i>n</i>â <i>s</i>rûyate, tâvad ayam svarge loke vasatîti.
And thus says your Scripture: ‘So long as a
man is known in this world by a good work, so
long does he dwell in heaven.’... How happy
I should be if I could spend some time at Calcutta
or Benares, and discuss with you and your learned
Pandits your ancient religion, your sacred writings,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>your traditions, and the future of religion in India.
It was not mere idle curiosity that led me to a
study of the Veda, but a wish to know a work
which has been for so many centuries the foundation
on which millions and millions of human beings
have built up their religious convictions. However
much we may differ from the old forms of faith and
worship, it is our duty, it seems to me, to approach
every religion with respect, nay, with reverence.
The vital principle, the original source of religion,
is the same everywhere; it is faith in a Higher
Power, and a belief that our moral life should be
such as to please Him to whom we owe our being
and to whom we feel bound to ascribe the highest
perfection which our limited human faculties can
conceive. Nor have I been disappointed by the
Rig-Veda, though it is different from what I and
others expected. There are large portions in it
which have hardly any connection with religion at
all, but they are interesting all the same as relics
of antiquity, such as the song of the gambler, the
dialogue between Lopamudrâ and Agastya, between
Yama and Yamî, between Purûravas and Urva<i>s</i>î.
Other prayers for health and wealth are appropriate
in their simplicity to a very primitive state of
society. But there are passages which show a
truly religious spirit, such as ‘Eka<i>m</i> sad viprâ bahudhâ
vadanti’—‘The sages speak in many ways
of the One that exists’; ‘Yo deveshu adhi deva
eka âsît’—‘He who alone is God above gods.’
Simple moral sentiments also occur in it which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>deserve to be treasured; such is ‘Vi ma<i>k</i> <i>kh</i>rathâya
rasanâm ivâga<i>h</i>’—‘Loose from me sin like a
rope’; ‘Dâmeva vatsâd vi mumugdhy a<i>m</i>ho, na
hi tvadâre nimishas <i>k</i>a ne<i>s</i>e’—‘Loose from me
sin like a rope from a calf, for away from Thee
I am not master of a twinkling of the eye.’ Though
their number is small in the Sanhitâ, yet there is
so much more simplicity and purity in most of
these old hymns that I cannot understand how they
could ever have been superseded by the Purâ<i>n</i>as,
works which from a moral, religious, and intellectual
point of view do not seem to me worthy to rank
as the Bibles of a nation so highly gifted as the
inhabitants of Âryâvarta.</p>

<p class='c006'>“If my edition of the Rig-Veda could help towards
bringing the people of India back to the study of
what their ancient writers unanimously considered
as the highest authority of their religion, it would,
I think, be an important step forward, not backward,
though I hope that the future has even
greater things in store for them than a mere return
to their ancient form of belief and worship. We
must not forget that, like everything else, religions
also grow old and can seldom defy four thousand
years. The antiquity of a religion which is often
appealed to as a proof of its truth, seems to me
to tell in the very opposite direction. The older
it is, the more likely it is to have become effete
in human hands, and unfit for new times, and to
require either reformation or entire abolition, to
make room for a new and better form of faith.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>“I know you are bound to consider me as a
Mle<i>kkh</i>a, but allow me to say that I do not entertain
the same exclusive feelings towards you and
your countrymen. And remember that one of your
Vedic Rishis says that all the castes, the Sûdra as
well as the Brâhmana, came from Brahman, and
participate, therefore, in the same nature and substance,
the Divine in man. We believe that all
men are equal before God, and with that feeling
and in that spirit I remain, with great respect,</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I shall, with the same caution as before, add one
more letter, though I know I shall be very much
blamed for doing so. The Râjah in expressing his
own sentiments, expressed no doubt the sentiments
of the society in which he moved, and the crisis
through which the conservative and orthodox party
passed at that time, unimportant as it may seem
to us, was full of vital problems for the future of
the religion of the cultivated classes of India. On
March 5, 1855, Râdhâkânta Deva wrote:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have lately received through the Bengal Government
a copy of the second volume of the Rig-Veda,
as a present from the Honourable the Court of
Directors, and I can ill express the feelings of
mingled joy and admiration with which I grasped
this most precious gift. Our Pandits are startled
out of their wits, and scarcely credit their senses,
when they are told that the sacred volume before
them has been edited by a distant European scholar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>who had no opportunities of consulting with a
Vaidik Pandit, who had to collect, copy out, and
collate various manuscripts of texts and commentaries,
mutilated and corrupted, and to refer to the
scanty and almost inaccessible sources of information
on the subject for the purpose of ascertaining
their genuine reading, and then with aching eyes
to revise the proof-sheets.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Great is the obligation under which you have laid
the learned world. By your successfully embarking
on such an arduous undertaking, you have done to
the Hindus an inestimable benefit, supplying them
with a correct and superb edition of their Holy
Scriptures. Accept therefore my most grateful and
sincere thanks, which, in common with my countrymen,
I owe you, and my special acknowledgments
for the very kind and obliging manner in which
you have noticed my name and work in the preface
to the second volume of the Rig-Veda. At the
conclusion of this preface is to be found a truly
poetic touch, a noble, frank, and irresistible gush
of feeling for the irreparable loss sustained by the
literary world and you personally, on the termination
of the earthly career of Eugène Burnouf.
I wish I could find terms adequate to respond to
your sympathy; we cannot be too lavish of eulogies
for his merits, or weary of dirges for his loss. In
the few letters he has written to me I find a noble
trait of humility and simplicity in his character
which is the invariable exponent of a great mind.</p>

<p class='c006'>“In 1833 on the occasion of acknowledging the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>present of the Sabda-kalpa-druma he says: ‘<span lang="fr">Ce
n’est pas à un Européen qui est à peine sur le seuil
de cette vaste science de l’Inde, qu’il appartient de
juger une composition de ce mérite et d’une telle
étendue. Des hommes comme les Colebrooke et
les Wilson, qui ont puisé la grande partie de leurs
connaissances à la source des entretiens brahmaniques,
sont les juges les plus dignes d’un aussi
beau travail.</span>’</p>

<p class='c006'>“In 1840, when he had the kindness to send me
a copy of his fine edition of the Bhâgavata Purâ<i>n</i>a,
he—the first decipherer of the Cuneiform inscriptions—the
first Pali scholar and historian of Buddhism—the
first editor and interpreter of the Zend-Avesta—and
the great Sanskrit philologist—thus
speaks of himself: ‘<span lang="fr">Mais, vous songerez que c’est
l’œuvre d’un lointain Mletchha qui ne fait que commencer
à balbutier la langue des grands et vénérables
Rishis....</span>’</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wishing you a long life to crown all your undertakings
with success, and requesting you to offer
my best regards to my learned friend Professor

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I repeat once more that I must decline all the
undeserved compliments paid to me by my Indian
correspondents, who, though they show so perfect
a mastery of English, are hardly aware that in the
North our language is less warm and less sunny
than in the South, and that we leave many things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>unsaid which must bring a blush to the cheeks of
any one who knows himself, and knows how very
imperfect his knowledge really is, and how far below
his ideals the execution of the work of his life has
remained. If Burnouf said that he was only
beginning to stammer Sanskrit, what shall I, his
unworthy pupil, say? But the letters themselves
are important as showing the attitude assumed by
the conservative orthodox party in India, when the
first edition of their Sacred Book fell among them
like a bombshell. For years, for centuries, nay for
thousands of years, this Veda on which their whole
religion was founded had been to them a kind of
invisible power, much as the Bible was in the early
centuries of the Papacy, when the privileged only were
supposed to know it and were allowed to interpret
it. In discussions between Brâhmans and Christian
missionaries, this Veda had always been the last
stronghold of the Brâhmans. Whatever was held
up to them as a doctrine peculiar to Christianity,
was met by them with the ready reply that it had
been taught long ago in the Vedas also. But this
Veda itself was never produced when they were
asked to point out chapter and verse. Long after
the MSS. of other Sanskrit texts had been freely
communicated to English students, the MSS. of the
Veda were kept apart, and the touch, nay the very
look of an unbeliever was supposed to desecrate
them. And now the book was there, handled by
everybody, and spelt out more or less successfully
by anybody acquainted with Sanskrit. The Brâhmans
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>always accept the inevitable, but we shall see
how, with a better knowledge of the Veda, there
sprang up discussions as to its divine or revealed
character, and how these discussions led gradually
to the formation of a new religious sect, which,
though at present confined to small circles, will no
doubt in the end stir the millions, and produce a
reformation in a country which seemed to be unchangeable.
Of this I shall have to speak later on,
when I gather up my reminiscences of Keshub
Chunder Sen and his fellow-workers. Movements
in which we are interested and engaged ourselves
from their beginnings seem generally much smaller
to us than they really are in the light of history.
When Luther was translating the Bible in the castle
of the Wartburg, he little dreamt that he was laying
the foundation of a new Church in Germany and
in all Teutonic countries, nor did Rammohun Roy
on his deathbed at Bristol foresee what would grow
up from the few hints he had thrown out as to
the possibility of a reform and a revival of the
ancient national religion of his country. But Debendranâth
followed, Keshub Chunder Sen followed,
and if the fire they lit does not at present burn
and shine so brightly as it ought, it will certainly
not die, but burst out again; for the way which
those heroes pointed out is the only possible way
leading from the past to the future, from ancient
to modern religion, from darkness to light. Many
who have lived in India and who imagine that they
know India, because they know Calcutta or Bombay,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>are inclined to shrug their shoulders and to look
down with superior wisdom and pity on those
misguided dreamers, as they call them, who imagine
that they can guide millions to a higher and
more truly religious life. We may not live to see
the hopes of Rammohun Roy or Keshub Chunder
Sen realised; but, as certainly as the sun rises in
the morning, the new light for India will break
forth from that East to which those prophets and
martyrs pointed in the last moments of their life.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Râjah Râdhâkânta Deva was a conservative
of the purest water, not touched as yet even by
that conservative liberalism which guided Debendranâth
Tagore and made him sympathise with,
though it kept him for a time aloof from, his bolder
pupil and friend, Keshub Chunder Sen. He himself
seems to have never doubted the divine authority
of the Veda, and in a curious controversy which
I had with him on the Burning of Widows he held
his ground firmly as a defender of the old ways.
As we became better acquainted with the Veda,
it became perfectly clear that the verse from the
Rig-Veda which was cited by the Brâhmans as
the supreme command for the burning of widows,
had been tampered with. The Brâhmans themselves
seem to have felt that so barbarous and
murderous a custom as the burning of widows,
whatever its origin may have been, could only
be defended by an authority that was admitted
to be infallible and superhuman. Such was the
Rig-Veda, and they did not shrink from altering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>a verse which occurred in a funeral hymn of that
Veda, so that instead of conveying a command
to the widows to return to their home after
having performed the last duty to their departed
husbands, it came to mean that they should enter
into the womb of fire to follow their husbands
to a better world. How such a falsification could
have been committed is difficult to understand,
when we consider that at first the falsification had
to be made in the thousands of memories which
represented the real copies of the Rig-Veda. It
must have taken place at a very early time,
because cases of Sutti do occur, if not in the
Rig-Veda, at least in the ancient popular tradition
of India, as represented to us in the Mahâbhârata.
Even Râdhâkânta Deva seemed inclined at last
to agree with me that in the Veda, as we possess
it, there is no direct command for this terrible
custom; but he took his stand on the old tradition
and maintained that we did not possess the whole
of the ancient Vedic literature, and that the
authority for the old custom may have existed
in one of the lost <i>S</i>âkhâs or branches of the
Veda. This was a favourite argument with Indian
casuists, but Indian casuists had likewise found an
answer to it. They called it the “skull argument,”
and reasoned that as little as a skull could be
accepted as a witness in a court of law, could
a lost <i>S</i>âkhâ of the Veda be appealed to as an
authority for a custom like the burning of widows.</p>

<p class='c006'>All this gives us an insight into the thoughts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>that rule Indian society, of which even those who
spend their best years in India have hardly any
suspicion. That an educated Hindu should defend
the burning of widows seems strange; still, if Popes
and Cardinals could defend auto-da-fé’s or the
burning of heretics, nay, even of witches, because
the fire would purify and save their souls which
could not be saved otherwise, why should not
an Indian Râjah have been convinced that the
burning of widows could not be wrong, believing,
as he did, that it was enjoined by a lost <i>S</i>âkhâ
of the Veda, and that the poor women could not
be saved unless they followed their husbands on
their heels into another world? These are ingrained
feelings, and every Hindu would at once
recite the popular verses, “Accompanying her
husband, she shall reside so long in Svarga
(Heaven) as are the thirty-five millions of hairs
on the human body.”</p>

<p class='c006'>A loyal wife is defined as “she whose sympathy
feels the pains and joys of her husband, who mourns
and pines in his absence, and dies when he dies.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In theory this is all very beautiful, and that
there may have been cases where a widow wished
to be burnt on her husband’s pile, can hardly be
doubted<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c017'><sup>[1]</sup></a>. It is well known that this custom of
widow-burning, or of widows dying with their
husbands, was by no means confined to India;
but it is known also, now that the pages of the
Veda are open to us, that the Veda certainly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>does not countenance it. The custom seems to
have arisen with the warrior caste, and I still
feel inclined to think that in its origin it was
voluntary, and arose from blind, passionate love,
and a strong belief in an immediate meeting
again in a better world. The idea that its object
was to deter wives from poisoning their husbands
is simply preposterous, and though it may be
quite true that at present the life of a widow
has been rendered so miserable that many would
willingly prefer death to so wretched an existence
as that of a widow, that too could not account
for so ancient and so widely spread a custom.
In our own ancient Teutonic mythology, when
Baldur had been murdered and his body had
been placed in a ship to be carried out to sea,
his wife, Nanna, died of grief, and was burnt
with him on the same pile<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c017'><sup>[2]</sup></a>. And Gudrun
(Brynhild) also, after Sigurd had been slain, had
but one wish, to be burnt with him on the same
pile, two servants at their head and two at their
feet, two dogs also and two hawks, and the
biting sword between them, the same sword that
lay between them when they slept together on the
same bed, like brother and sister<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c017'><sup>[3]</sup></a>. There is
humanity in all this inhuman barbarism, if only
we try to discover it. The strange part is that
this human feeling should have manifested itself
in the women only, and never in the men.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>MY INDIAN FRIENDS.<br> <br> II.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c011'>Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a Goreh.</h3>

<p class='c012'>If I knew the Râjah Râdhâkânta Deva by correspondence
only, the next son of India whom
I came to know, and for a time very intimately,
as one knows and loves a friend, had travelled
all the way from India, having come to England
with Dhulip Singh. While I was sitting in my
room at Oxford copying Sanskrit MSS., a gentleman
was shown in, dressed in a long black coat,
looking different from my usual visitors, and addressing
me in a language of which I did not
understand a single word. I spoke to him in
English, and asked him what language he was
speaking, and he replied with great surprise, “Do
you not understand Sanskrit?” “No,” I said,
“I have never heard it spoken, but here are some
MSS. of the Veda which will interest you.” He
was delighted to see them, and began to read,
but he had soon to confess that he was not able
to translate a single word. When I expressed my
surprise—though perhaps I ought not to have done
so—he told me that he did not believe in the
Veda any longer, but had become a Christian.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>His countenance was most intelligent, and almost
heavy with thought, his language and his manners
most winning, and we were soon deep in conversation.
His name had been Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a Goreh—Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a
being a name of <i>S</i>iva (the Blue-neck)—but
had been changed into Nehemiah Goreh, when
he became a Christian. I have tried to find out
more about his birth-place and his parents, but in
vain; and, after all, who cares for all these monotonous
details with which biographers generally
fill the first chapters of their books? Nor did
I care much for them myself, except to know that
he came from a highly respected Brâhman family,
and that his father had been an educated man and
a Sanskrit scholar. What I really cared for was
the man himself, such as he stood before me, a
man, I should have guessed, of about five-and-twenty,
glowing with youthful enthusiasm, and
evidently brimful of thought. I must leave it to
others to supply the year of his birth and all the
details of his paternal and maternal genealogy.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was not long before I discovered a sad and
perplexed tone in his conversation, and, though
he assured me that nothing but a deep conviction
of the truth of Christ’s teaching had induced him
to change his religion, he told me that he was in
great anxiety and did not know what to do for
the future. What he had seen of England, more
particularly of London, was not what he had
imagined a Christian country to be. His patron,
Dhulip Singh, had placed him at some kind of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>missionary seminary in London, where he found
himself together with a number of what he considered
half-educated and narrow-minded young
men, candidates for ordination and missionary work.
They showed him no sympathy and love, but found
fault with everything he did and said. He had
been, as I soon found out, a careful student of
Hindu philosophy, and his mind had passed through
a strict philosophical discipline. Hindu philosophy
is in many respects as good a discipline as Plato
or Aristotle, and, Christian though he was, he was
familiar with the boldest conceptions of the world,
as found in the six systems of Hindu philosophy,
and he could argue with great subtlety and accuracy
on any of the old problems of the human mind.
The fact was he stood too high for his companions,
and they were evidently unable to understand and
appreciate his thoughts. He did not use words
at random, and was always ready to give a definition
of them, whenever they seemed ambiguous.
And yet this man was treated as a kind of nigger
by those who ought to have been not only kind,
but respectful to him. He was told that smoking
was a sin, and that he never could be a true
Christian if he abstained from eating meat, particularly
beef. He told me that with the greatest
effort he had once brought himself to swallow a
sandwich containing a slice of meat, but it was
to him what eating human flesh would be to us.
He could not do it again. When he thus found
himself in this thoroughly uncongenial society, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>saw nothing in London of what he had supposed
a Christian city to be, he ran away, and came to
Oxford to find me, having heard of my interest in
India, in its religion, and its ancient literature.
He had evidently dreamt of a Christian country
where everybody loved his neighbour as himself;
where everybody, if struck on the right cheek,
would turn the other also; where everybody, when
robbed of his coat, would give up his cloak also.
All this, as we know, is not the fashion in the
streets of London, and what he actually saw in
those streets was so different from his ideals that
he said to me, “If what I have seen in London
is Christianity, I want to go back to India; if
that is Christianity, I am not a Christian.” This
sounded very ominous, and I hardly knew what
to say or what to do with him. He was not a
man to be smoothed down by a few kind words.
I tried to find out first why he had given up his
native religion, and the more I heard, the more
I was amazed. He began life as a worshipper of
<i>S</i>iva, had then chosen K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a as his deity, and,
dissatisfied with this form of worship also, had
proceeded to study the Korân. All that time he
had kept carefully aloof from Christian missionaries
and Christian converts. But when he saw that
the Korân also was full of contradictions and of
things which he could not approve, he began to
study by himself both the Old and the New Testaments.
Saturated as he was with philosophical ideas,
he soon found that these books also did not satisfy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>his yearnings, and he wrote, as I was told, two
essays in Sanskrit, one against the Old, the other
against the New Testament, both directed against
a book written by my old friend, J. Muir, the
Mataparîkshâ (Examination of Doctrines). Those
who knew him at the time in India say that his
answer to the Scotch scholar was in flowing and
melodious Sanskrit, and was “alike most classical in
diction and irrefragable in reasoning.” Christianity
in India, even as represented by so enlightened
a Christian as J. Muir, was supposed to have received
its death-blow by it. But the fact was, that
in studying the New Testament and trying to refute
it, he had become a Christian unawares.</p>

<p class='c006'>When I asked him to tell me how in the end he
succumbed, and was satisfied with the religion of
Christ, he shook his head and said, “I can explain
everything, I can explain why I rejected <i>S</i>iva, and
K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a, and Allah, and tell you everything that
kept me back so long from Christianity, as preached
to us in India, and made me reject the New as
well as the Old Testament as unsatisfactory to
a thinking man. But why and how I became a
Christian I cannot explain. I was caught as in a
net, and I could not get away from Christ.” This
did not quite satisfy me, and I pressed him hard
several times to find out whether there had not
been any other inducement, perhaps unknown to
himself at the time, that might have influenced him
in taking this momentous step. But it was all in
vain. So far from there being any worldly motives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>mixed up with his conversion, all outward circumstances,
on the contrary, were strongly against his
professing himself a Christian. He could not tell
me of any missionary or teacher whose personal
influence might directly or indirectly have told on
him.</p>

<p class='c006'>No one was more surprised than the clergyman,
to whom he wrote that he was a Christian, that
he required no instruction or persuasion, but simply
wished to be baptized. His mind was like a crystal,
perfectly bright and transparent. He held nothing
back from me, but the answer which I most cared
for, he could not give. His father, a learned man,
holding a high place among the Brâhmans socially,
a kind of bishop or dean, as we should call it, owed
it to his position, not only to disown, but to disinherit,
nay, publicly to curse, his son. The loss
of his fortune was nothing to the son; but when
it came to the curse, the father himself shrank
back. He loved his son, and it is hinted that to
a certain extent he may have shared his feelings.
So, in order to evade the necessity of the curse,
he retired from the world and took upon himself
the vow of perpetual silence (Mauna-vrata). We
wonder at the Trappists and their silence, but they
at all events live in company with other Trappists.
But to be silent among friends who speak must
be a greater trial still. These men generally retire
from the world altogether. Nehemiah Goreh’s
father, after he had retired into the forest, never
uttered a single word again to any human being.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>He disappeared altogether, and, though for several
years his son and his friends hoped that he would
return, he never came back. He probably went
out of his mind, and died, as many Sannyâsins die
in the forests of India. There are more tragedies
in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in our
philosophy. Nor was that all. Even his wife was
taken away from the new convert, though she really
was devoted to her husband. Timid as Hindu
ladies are, his young wife had been frightened when
asked before a judge whether she would remain
with her apostate husband or return to her parents.
This is what the law enjoins in case of a husband
becoming a Christian. But after she had taken
refuge in her parental home she repented, and
wished to join her husband again. And here a
curious scene occurred. The husband actually had
to elope with his own wife, and carry her off by
main force. After that the law allows a new appeal;
the guilty couple were brought once more before
a judge, and when the young wife (she was only
thirteen) was asked what she wished to do, she
declared publicly that she would remain with her
husband, and was then allowed to return to him and
to her home. What more could a man sacrifice
for his religious convictions? All I can say is that
in the whole of my life I have never seen so true
a Christian, so true a martyr, as Nehemiah Goreh.
Few Christians, not even bishops, would have
passed through such ordeals unscathed. And with
all that, he was a philosopher, he knew what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>philosophy could say and had said on the possibility
of revelation and of religion, and yet he was
perfectly satisfied with Christianity in its very
simplest form. One thing he said sometimes, to
account to me for the momentous step he had
taken, and for the sacrifices he had made to retain
his inward honesty. “Christianity is so pure,” he
said. One can quite understand how this purity
must have told on a mind that had waded through
the impurities of the sombre worship of Siva, and
the lascivious innuendos of the legends of Krishna
and the shepherdesses, however much they may be
explained as a mere allegory. Even as an allegory,
the story of a god who carries off the clothes of
the shepherdesses while bathing, is not edifying.
If it is meant for devotion without guise or disguise,
the meaning is too much hidden for ordinary
mortals. We may be able to account historically
or mythologically for many excrescences of religion,
but we cannot dispute them away, nor can we
wonder that a pure mind, sickened by them, should
turn with a delightful relief to the pure and fresh
atmosphere of Christianity.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was for a time real danger of Nehemiah’s
falling into utter despair, and all that his friends
could do was to send him back, as soon as possible,
to India, and to find him some occupation there as
a teacher and Scripture reader. There, what seems
almost an innate tendency of the Indian mind soon
developed itself in Nehemiah, namely, asceticism
and a complete renunciation of the world. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>a time he was attracted by outward ceremonial and
symbolism, and found comfort in it; but when that
also failed to satisfy him, he became, to all intents
and purposes, a Christian Sannyâsin (hermit). For
himself he wanted nothing, even controversy had
no longer any charm for him; though, in the essays
which he was induced to address to his countrymen
on the insufficiency of the six systems of native
philosophy, he proved himself a subtle critic of
Hinduism, and a powerful defender of Christianity.
These essays, originally written in Hindi, have been
translated into English by Dr. Fitz-Edward Hall,
under the title of “Rational Refutation of the
Hindu Philosophical Systems,” Calcutta, 1862, and
they are extremely interesting and useful.</p>

<p class='c006'>Judging from letters which I received from him
from time to time, he never quite recovered the
balance of his mind. His trials had been too much
for him. Not only had he lost his father and his
wife, but he became separated even from his children,
so that no cares of this world should disturb
his peace with God and in God. But to give up
a religion—the religion of our father and mother,
the religion of our childhood and of all our friends,
however imperfect it may be from our own point
of view, inflicts a wound that heals but slowly, and
is apt to break open again and again. Why should
missionaries fail to see this, and expect from their
heathen pupils sacrifices which they themselves
would shrink from by a natural instinct of self-preservation?
It is no answer to say that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>religion of those whom they wish to bring over to
Christianity is antiquated, vulgar, hideous, and false.
The religion in which a man is born, the religion of
a man’s father and mother, has always something
sacred in it that ought to be respected. Is there
a single missionary who, if he had been born a
Hindu or a Parsi, would have embraced Christianity
without a struggle? When we consider how unimportant
the differences are between the religion
of reformed and unreformed Christians if compared
with the treasures that both share in common, why
should it be such a wrench for a Roman Catholic
to become a Protestant, except that his father and
mother were Roman Catholics? The points of
difference between them are all, without exception,
the work of men, and often of men who have no
very high record in the pages of history. Yet to
give up the mass for the eucharist, the wafer for
the bread, the mixed for the pure wine, has often
been too much even for a truly Christian heart, and
has separated those who were meant to be brothers
in Christ. I say all this only in order to make
people understand what trials and tortures Nehemiah
Goreh had to undergo before he could take
that step which, from a missionary point of view,
seems so easy and natural. To be torn away from
all our friends, to think that they are all wrong and
we alone are right, was too great an effort to a
sensitive mind, such as his was, and left a wound
behind which it required a very strong and healthy
nature to bear and many years to heal. That he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>should have become a kind of Christian Sannyâsin,
or anchorite, was natural; that he should have been
attracted for a time by childish ritualism was a
pity. This, however, was chiefly due to personal
influences, and, if it in any way soothed his broken
spirits, no one would grudge him such anodynes.
I was much touched when, in one of his later
letters, after expressing his perfect satisfaction with
what Christianity had given him, he added, “Yet,
I often feel like a man who has taken poison.” He
was for many years a useful member of a Christian
brotherhood at Sigra, founded by the Rev. R. M.
Benson, whom I remember meeting often in old
days in the cheerful common-room of Christ Church.
They were very kind to him, and he was most
grateful to his brothers. Yet I feel doubtful
whether even they understood him fully, and made
allowance for all his troubles and all his sacrifices.</p>

<p class='c006'>When Nehemiah Goreh was in England for the
last time, and staying at Oxford, he was not allowed
to come to see me, except on the very day of his
departure. This was unkind to both of us; he was
in no more danger from me than I was from him.
I know that in his early days he had used the wings
of his mind with great freedom, that he had tried
to soar to the highest abodes of the Divine, and
to fathom the deepest abysses of human nature,
fearless of all consequences. He reminded me in
that respect of Dr. Pusey, who often declared that
he had studied more heresy than anybody else;
but, having seen the horrors of utter darkness on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>every side, he felt it his duty to warn others, and
to keep them from seeing what he had seen.
Strange only that Nehemiah, brought up as he
had been in the doctrines of the Vedânta, should
not have seen how even the highest heights and
the deepest depths which can be reached by the
human mind are lighted up by the omnipresence
of Brahman, the Indian name and concept of what
we mean by the omnipresent Father, or, if you
like, of that ineffable Godhead of which even the
Father is one person only. He had become tired
of his lifelong search, and had long closed his eyes
to this world of seeming. When at last his heart
ceased to beat, he felt satisfied that all was well, and
that he was safe in trusting in Christ.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is curious that he should not have drawn more
of his countrymen to follow him. His original
conception of Christ’s teaching was such that many
an excellent Hindu could honestly have accepted
it. If anywhere, the harvest is ripe in India, and
the labourers are many. Unfortunately his philosophical
Christianity became more and more ecclesiastical,
nay ritualistic in time, through influences
which he was too weak to resist. He might have
done a great work in India; but what India wants
is the young and vigorous Christianity of the first
century, not the effete Christianity of the fifteenth
century, still less its poor modern imitations. Much
the same opinion was expressed by an Indian correspondent,
Mr. Brojolall Chuckerbutty, a personal
friend and admirer of Nehemiah Goreh. In one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>his letters to me he said: “Years ago I had
a long discussion in my own house with Nehemiah
Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a Goreh concerning the Christian religion.
He, of course, tried hard to convert me to his
faith. But we arrived at a conclusion in which
nothing was concluded. I really could not understand
how a man of Mr. Goreh’s intelligence and
learning, who had discarded Hinduism, could accept,
in its stead, popular Christianity which stands on
the same level with popular Hinduism. By popular
Christianity I mean the Christianity of the Church,
as contra-distinguished from the Christianity of
Christ.”</p>

<p class='c006'>His friends have sometimes found fault with
Nehemiah Goreh for having during the latter part
of his life so completely withdrawn himself from
the world and its social obligations. But here too
we must learn to make allowances for the old
Indian leaven. He longed for rest. It was a
recognised thing in India—I speak, of course, of
ancient India—that a man who had fought his
fight might retire from the world, shake off all
shackles, and become free, even here on earth.
Many left their homes and lived in forests—a most
delightful way of life in India. These anchorites,
fugitives from the world, wanted very little to
support life, and that little, so far as we know,
was either supplied by nature or given them readily
by the members of their family, or even by
strangers. There was no lack of family affection
in India, but higher than all worldly affections stood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>the ideal of Vairâgya, freedom from all desires and
passions, freedom from all worldly attachments,
freedom from all that must perish, real happiness
in the Eternal, in the Self, that is, in God who
changes not. Some of the most beautiful poetry
of ancient and modern India was inspired by that
sentiment of unworldliness, the very opposite of
that passionate love and attachment which forms
the constant theme of European poetry. Love, so
far as it means passion and desire, or exclusive
attachment to one person, was considered as of
this world, and everything belonging to this world
was perishable, and therefore not worthy of our
highest affection. The Buddhists adopted the same
doctrine, but, while condemning love, they preached
pity—a splendid substitute. Father and mother,
wife, husband, and children were not excepted.
They, too, should never be passionately loved or
idolised, but they should always be pitied. That
pity means a great deal, it may mean all that is
best in love. The very relation in which husband
and wife, father and mother, parents and children
stood to each other could be of this life only, not
of that life in which they neither marry nor are
given in marriage, the life that underlies even this
life on earth. We find it difficult to enter into
these ideas, they are so entirely absent from our
own literature, particularly from our poetry; which
deals mostly with passionate love, but they were
quite familiar to the Hindus. We call them strange
and curious and extravagant, and then we have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>done with them. But the subject is not so easily
disposed of, and in a country such as India, it is
difficult to say who has chosen the good part.
There the man at rest with himself and with his
God, the man free from all worldly fetters, was
a recognised character, and was allowed to live up
to his ideals without let or hindrance. How those
ideals were realised we may learn from Indian
poetry, from the Vairâgya-<i>S</i>ataka, for instance (the
century of dispassionateness) ascribed to Bhart<i>ri</i>hari,
and from many similar works. There we
read<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c017'><sup>[4]</sup></a>:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A hermit’s forest cell, and fellowship with deer,</div>

<p class='c006'>A more literal translation would be:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dwelling in a hallowed forest, nay fellowship
with deer, pure diet of fruit, and stones for beds
from day to day, such are the requirements of
those who desire to worship Hara; but for those
whose minds are entirely fixed and pacified, forest
or house is alike.” (No. 33, ed. Gopinâth.)</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>I give a few more verses in prose translations,
as more faithful, though less perfect than poetry:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“The earth has been dug by me in hope of
treasure, the ore of the mountains has been
melted, the ocean has been crossed, and princes
have been zealously served, nights have been
passed among the graves with a mind bent on
propitiating by charms; yet have I not obtained
a doit. O Desire, leave me now!” (No. 4, ed.
Gopinâth.)</p>

<p class='c006'>“Even if they have longer remained with us,
the objects of sense are sure to vanish. What
difference is there in the separation, that man
should not forsake them himself? If they pass
away by themselves, they cause the greatest
pain to the mind, but if we forsake them ourselves,
they cause endless happiness and peace.”
(No. 16, ed. Gopinâth.)</p>

<p class='c006'>“When pride is failing, when our wealth has
departed, when the beggar has gone away disappointed,
when our kinsmen have vanished and
our friends have disappeared, and youth is slowly
waning, one thing only befits the wise man—to
dwell somewhere in the arbour of a cave in the
valley of a high mountain where the rocks are
sanctified by the milk (waters) of the daughter
of <i>G</i>ahnu (Ga<i>m</i>gâ).” (No. 31.)</p>

<p class='c006'>“In health there is fear of disease, in family-pride
fear of a fall, in wealth fear of the king,
in silence fear of disregard, in strength fear of an
enemy, in beauty fear of old age, in knowledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>fear of blame, in virtue fear of calumny, in life
fear of death; everything on earth is surrounded

freedom from fear.” (No. 116.)</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where before there were many in the house,
there is left only one; where there was one,
there are now many, and in the end there is

together with Kâlî (death), with mortals as with
figures on a board.” (No. 38.)</p>

<p class='c006'>“Delights are unsteady like lightning, flashing
from the midst of a veil of clouds, life is fleeting
like a shower from a mass of clouds that have
been torn asunder by the wind; the caresses of
youth enjoyed by man are fickle. O ye wise,
when you have pondered this, set your heart
quickly on Yoga that can be gained by perfection
of meditation and firmness.” (No. 53.)</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are I, and I am you, such was formerly
our mind; what has happened now that you are
you and I am I?” (No. 63.)</p>

<p class='c006'>“What good is there in the Vedas, the Sm<i>ri</i>tis,
the reciting of the Purâ<i>n</i>as, and all the tedious
<i>S</i>âstras, or in the trouble of performing sacrifices
which are to reward us with an abode in the
arbours of the gardens of Svarga? If we except
only the compassing of an entrance into that
place where there is bliss in oneself and which
is like the fire at the end of the world which
destroys all that produces pains by means of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>fetters of existence, everything else is a mere
matter of bargain.” (No. 79.)</p>

<p class='c006'>“O mother Earth, father Wind, friend Light,

and spotless knowledge; I, shining with increase
of good works produced through contact with
you, I now melt away in the Highest Spirit
(Brahman).” (No. 85.)</p>

<p class='c006'>Ideas like these, very beautiful when clothed
in the beautiful language of ancient India, seemed
never to be absent from the mind of my friend,
though modified by the Christian atmosphere in
which he had learnt to breathe. He too would
have been happiest in the forest, on the banks
of the Ganges—a stone for his couch, the deer
for his friends, wild fruits for his food, lost in
his God, who was more to him than a mere
Jehovah, more also than the Brahman of the
multitude. He might have called him Brahman,
hidden under the features, or under the Pratîka
(<i>persona</i>) of a father. He himself, however, had
soared higher and discovered the true Brahman
in himself, and with all these exalted ideas he
had found rest and happiness in the humble
faith of a Christian. With him Christianity
would have been perfectly compatible with Indian
philosophy, particularly the Vedânta, if only properly
understood. Men such as Dr. Henry More
were Christian Platonists at Cambridge; why then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>should there be no Christian Vedântists, such as
Nehemiah Goreh was in the beginning of his career?
Later in life the bold eagle became tired, his pinions
faltered, and he yearned for his nest. He is at
rest now from all his doubts and earthly troubles.
His name is known to few only, and will soon be
forgotten altogether, like the names of many who
were martyrs to their convictions on earth. He
had the true courage of his convictions, and in my
memory he will always retain his place very near
to Stanley, Colenso, and a few others who shall
remain unnamed. If he changed later in life, I feel
sure that he changed honestly, and that he was as
true in his ecstatic adorations (Upâsanâ) as he had
been in his philosophy (G<i>ñ</i>âna).</p>

<h3 class='c013'>Keshub Chunder Sen.</h3>

<p class='c012'>While through Râdhâkânta I came in contact
with the rigid conservative elements of Indian
society, and in Nehemiah Goreh was able to witness
the first real conquest achieved by Christianity
and its concomitant powers over the Indian mind
in its highest excellence—for I doubt whether,
if left to itself, the Indian mind could reach
a higher degree of intellectual vigour than it did
in Nehemiah Goreh—a new phase of Indian life
was opened to me through my long friendship
with Keshub Chunder Sen. That contact with
Christianity would sooner or later produce a fermentation
in the religion of India might easily
have been foreseen. It was the same when Mohammedanism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>reached India. Both Mohammedanism
and Christianity were modern religions compared
with Brâhmanism, they belonged to a more advanced
state of thought and culture, and were free from
many of the childish ideas almost inseparable from
an earlier stage of religion in the history of mankind.
But, strange to say, the very antiquity of the
Vedic religion was looked upon as an argument in
its favour, and it certainly made its surrender more
difficult to its followers. Nânak, Kabir, Chaitanya,
and other reformers, near contemporaries of our own
reformers, tried to effect a compromise between the
two religions by eliminating the glaring imperfections
of the ancient national faith of India, such
as idol-worship, animal sacrifices, &#38;c., but retaining
its sublime moral and philosophical spirit, which, in
some respects, was purer and higher than even the
doctrines of the Korân. It may be useful to glance
at some of these reformers, if only to show that
Keshub Chunder Sen was not without his predecessors.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>Chaitanya.</h3>

<p class='c012'>The most important among these reformers
about the beginning of the sixteenth century was
Chaitanya (1485–1527). At all events he had the
largest following, and has so even to the present
day. He did not perhaps go quite so far as Keshub
Chunder Sen, but in many cases this modern reformer
seems certainly to have been influenced by the spirit
of Chaitanya, nay, in some cases, to have used
almost the same words. The followers of Chaitanya,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>whether they are called Gosains, Bhâgavatas,
Vairâgis, or other names, are said to form even now
one-fifth of the whole population of Bengal. Whether
for rules of life or for doctrine they still appeal to
Chaitanya and to his two fellow-workers, Advaitânanda
and Nityânanda, as their highest authorities.
They are outwardly worshippers of Vish<i>n</i>u in his
form of K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a, but by the more enlightened
among them, K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a or Vish<i>n</i>u is conceived as
Brahman or the Supreme Spirit. The social importance
of this reform consisted chiefly in the complete
ignoring of caste. “The teacher of the four Vedas,”
Chaitanya used to say, “is not my disciple, but the
faithful <i>K</i>a<i>nd</i>âla (outcast) enjoys my friendship.”
Even Mohammedans were received as brothers in
the faith, in fact the union of Hinduism and Islam
was one of the leading ideas of the time. Every
true disciple of Chaitanya had the right of begging
for alms, and was expected to lead an ascetic life.
At the same time there is a verse quoted as coming
from Chaitanya, which leaves the impression that
his ideas of asceticism were not very strict. “Let
all enjoy fish, broth, and women’s charms, be happy
and call upon Hari (Vish<i>n</i>u).” But if he saw no harm
in the enjoyment of life, resembling in this another
honest reformer, Luther, he protested and warned
his disciples against all worldly pleasures that would
draw away their thoughts from K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a. According
to an article lately published in the “Journal of the
Buddhist Text Society,” 1897, Vol. V, Part 4, p. 87,
Chaitanya taught, and his followers continue to teach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>that the original cause of all things was Wisdom.
That Divine Soul was believed to vivify all, and
to be the Lord of all and the Protector of all.
He is called spiritual, pure, and full of ecstasy.
The Vedas chant His praises unceasingly. It is
this Being, he taught, whom we call K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a. This
Supreme Being has three phases: (1) Brahman, the
light of the world that gives vitality to all. The
sages try to reach Him by wisdom. (2) Paramâtman,
he who is sentient, omnipresent, and omniscient.
The sages go to Him through contemplation or
Yoga; and (3) Bhagavat or the Personal God,
who manifests Himself in the material world. Men
try to reach Him through Bhakti (devotion).</p>

<p class='c006'>Some ascribe creation to matter: but this, according
to Chaitanya, is impossible. What power has
inert matter, he asks, that can produce so grand
a creation, filled with wisdom and beauty? It is
the will of an Almighty Being that brought this
universe into existence. It is impossible for man
even to think of His greatness.</p>

<p class='c006'>The human soul, the <i>G</i>îvâtman, is, according to
Chaitanya, an infinitesimal portion, like a ray,
of the Divine Being. God is like a blazing fire,
and the souls are like sparks that come out of it.
Deluded by Mâyâ, i.e. the attractions of the
world, the <i>G</i>îvâtman forgets its own nature: but
when it has recognised the transitory nature of all
things, it goes up again to its Maker.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many ascribe to this <i>G</i>îvâtman the attributes of
God. But this, according to Chaitanya, cannot be,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>because it has an individual character. <i>S</i>ruti (revelation)
says that he who thinks that he has found
out the nature of God knows nothing of Him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Chaitanya says that it is the duty of every man
to adore K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a and to perform good deeds without
any expectation of rewards. Bhakti (devotion)
is the channel that carries man to K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a. When
a devotee says, “O Lord, I am yours,” it is then
only that he can attain K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lastly, it must be the aim of every man to gain
K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a’s love, and Bhakti is the way that leads
to it. Chaitanya defined Bhakti as an uninterrupted
tendency of the heart towards God, just
like the flow of a river towards the sea.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is difficult to understand how the followers
of Mohammed could ever have been induced to
use the name of K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a for that of Allah, but
we know that it was so, and the same religious
amalgamation between Hinduism and Islam was
attempted by Nânak, the contemporary of Chaitanya.
The Sîkhs, though much changed in time,
are the followers of that reformer.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>Nânak and the Sîkhs.</h3>

<p class='c012'>It is a pity that we possess so little trustworthy information
about the original Sîkh reformers. Their
sacred book, the Granth, exists, nay, it has even been
translated into English by the late Dr. Trumpp. But
it turns out now that Dr. Trumpp was by no means
a trustworthy translator. The language of the
Granth is generally called old Penjâbi, and it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>supposed that a scholar who knew modern Penjâbi
might easily learn to understand the language as it
was four hundred years ago. But that is not the
case. The language of the Granth is said to be
full of local dialectic varieties and forgotten idioms,
so much so that it has been said to be without any
grammar at all. That is, of course, impossible, for
there is method even in what we might call grammatical
madness, and we may hope that such
a method may in time be discovered. Mr. Macauliffe,
who has spent many years among the Sîkhs,
and has with the help of their priests paid much
attention to their Granth, has given us some most
interesting and beautiful specimens of their poetry
which form part of their sacred book. Though
Nânak was the chief founder of the new religion
of the Sîkhs, that is of the <i>S</i>ishyas or disciples,
other well-known poets, such as A<i>m</i>gada, Râmdâs,
Râmânand, Kabîr, Farîd (a Mussulman), and Mira
Bir, a queen, are mentioned as his helpers and as
contributors to the Granth. Râmânand, a Brâhman,
or rather a Sannyâsin who had renounced many of
the old ceremonial restrictions, on being asked one
day to attend a Hindu religious worship, wrote the
following lines:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>“Whither shall I go? I am happy at home,</div>
      <div class='line'>My heart will not go with me; it has become a cripple.</div>
      <div class='line'>One day my heart desired to go;</div>
      <div class='line'>I ground sandal, took attar of roses and many perfumes,</div>
      <div class='line'>And was proceeding to worship in the temple of Brahm;</div>
      <div class='line'>But my spiritual guide showed me God in my heart.</div>
      <div class='line'>Wherever I go I find only water and stones (for bathing and worshipping);</div>
      <div class='line'>But thou, O God, art equally contained in everything.</div>
      <div class='line'>The Vedas and the Purâ<i>n</i>as I have all seen and searched.</div>
      <div class='line'>Go thou thither, if God be not here (in the heart).</div>
      <div class='line'>O true Guru, I am a sacrifice unto Thee,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who hast cut away all my perplexities and doubts.</div>
      <div class='line'>Râmânand’s Lord is the all-pervading God,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Guru’s word has cut away millions of acts (sins).”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Another and perhaps the greatest among the disciples
of Nânak was Kabîr, i.e. the Great. He was
strongly opposed to idol-worship. “If God is a
stone,” he used to say, “I will worship a mountain.”
Idol-worship was, of course, the greatest stumbling-block
in the way of a reconciliation between Hinduism
and Islam. Still the defenders of idol-worship
and the iconoclastic Mohammedans managed to come
to a certain understanding. They agreed to speak
each his own language, but to feel that they meant
the same. Why cannot Christians and Hindus do
the same, particularly when the best spirits among
the Hindus at least, have adopted a language
which shows that they are very near the Kingdom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>of God, nearer, I believe, than thousands who are
baptized and call themselves Christians? It is
most interesting to watch the compromise made
between Hinduism and Islam four hundred years
ago and to compare it with the compromise between
Hinduism and Christianity that is now so
eloquently advocated by the followers of Rammohun
Roy and Keshub Chunder Sen.</p>

<p class='c005'>Kabîr said:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“What availeth devotion, what penance, what fasting and worship,</div>
      <div class='line'>To him in whose heart there is worldly love?</div>
      <div class='line'>O man, apply thy heart to God:</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou shalt not obtain Him by artifice.</div>
      <div class='line'>Put away covetousness and regard for what people say of thee.</div>
      <div class='line'>Renounce lust, wrath, and pride.</div>
      <div class='line'>By the religious ceremonies (of the Hindus) conceit is produced,</div>
      <div class='line'>That if they join and worship a stone (they shall receive salvation).</div>
      <div class='line'>Saith Kabîr, by serving Him I have obtained the Lord.</div>
      <div class='line'>By becoming simple in heart I have met my God.</div>
    </div>

      <div class='line'>O my soul, I know that thou shalt depart.</div>
      <div class='line'>O silly one, know God!</div>
      <div class='line'>Wherever I look I see none but those who are entangled in worldly love.</div>
      <div class='line'>Men of Divine knowledge and meditation, great preachers, all are engrossed in this world’s affairs.</div>
      <div class='line'>Saith Kabîr, without the name of the One God, this world is blinded by Mammon.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>By the favour of the Guru the slave Kabîr loveth God.</div>
      <div class='line'>O Brethren, the Vedas and Mohammedan books are lies, and free not the mind from anxiety.</div>
      <div class='line'>If for a moment thou restrain thy mind, God shall appear before thee.</div>
      <div class='line'>O man, search thy heart daily, that thou mayest not fall into despair.</div>
      <div class='line'>This world is a magic show which hath no tangibility.</div>
      <div class='line'>Men read falsehood and are pleased; they quarrel over what they do not understand.</div>
      <div class='line'>The truth is, the Creator is contained in the Creation. He is not of a blue colour, like K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Nânak himself expresses his devotion to the
true God in the following words:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“Were a mansion of pearls erected and inlaid with gems for me,</div>
      <div class='line'>Perfumed with musk, fragrant aloe, and sandal, so as to confer delight—</div>
      <div class='line'>May it not be that on beholding it I should forget Thee and not remember Thy name!</div>
      <div class='line'>My soul burneth without God.</div>
      <div class='line'>I have ascertained from my Guru that there is no other shelter than thou, O God.</div>
      <div class='line'>Were the earth to be studded with diamonds and rubies, and my couch to be similarly adorned,</div>
      <div class='line'>Were fascinating damsels, whose faces shine with jewels, to shed lustre and diffuse pleasure,</div>
      <div class='line'>May it not be that on beholding them, I should forget Thee, and not remember Thy name!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The following verses will show what was in the
mind of Nânak and of his followers, and we know
from history how well their labours for conciliation
between Hindus and Mohammedans succeeded, at
least for a time, and how what seems to us impossible
at present was fully achieved by them. Rammohun
Roy and Keshub Chunder Sen would gladly have
joined in the following words of the Granth:—</p>

<p class='c019'>“Some men are Hindus and some Musalmans.</p>

<p class='c019'>Among the latter are Rawazis, Imams, and Sufis;
know that all men are of the same caste.</p>

<p class='c019'>The Creator and the Beneficent are the same;
the Provider and the Merciful are the same,
there is no difference, let no one suppose so
even by mistake.</p>

<p class='c019'>Worship the One God, He is the one Divine
Guru after all; know that His form is one,
and that He is the one light diffused in all.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>The Temple and the Mosque are the same, the
Hindu worship and the Musalman prayer are
the same; all men are the same; it is through
error they appear different.</p>

<p class='c019'>Allah and Alekh are the same, the Purâ<i>n</i>as and
the Korân are the same; they are all alike,
it is the One God who created all.”</p>

<p class='c006'>No wonder then that Rammohun Roy and
Keshub Chunder Sen should have been hopeful
that their endeavours also might be crowned by
the same success as Nânak’s, and that their new
Church would have included not only the believers
in the Vedas and the Korân, but the believers in
the Bible also. They both tried very hard to
come to an understanding with the representatives
of Christianity in India. It is the same even now.
There are men who can speak in the name of the
Indian people at large, and whose example would
tell on the masses who in every country have to
be led by their own men of light and leading.
Mozoomdar, the natural successor of Keshub Chunder
Sen, would not recede a step from the position
which his great predecessors took up with regard
to Christianity. The idea that his Samâj was in
any sense opposed to Christianity or jealous of it
would be scouted by him as it was by Keshub
Chunder Sen. “Woe unto me,” Keshub wrote, “if
ever I harboured in my mind the remotest desire
to found a new sect, and thus add to the already
accumulated evils of sectarianism! Woe unto us,
if I ever conceived the project of setting up a movement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>against the Church of Christ! Perish these
lips if they utter a word of rebellion against Jesus.
And let the genial currents of my life-blood be
curdled at this very moment, if I glory in the hateful
ambition of rising against my master. A new
sect! God forbid. We preach not a new sect, but
the death of sectarianism and the universal reconciliation
of all churches. But the very idea of an
eclectic church, it will be contended, is anti-Christian.
To mix up Christ with the hundred and one creeds
of the world is to destroy and deny Christ. To mix
Christ with what? With error, with impurity?
No. Mix Christ with all that is Christian in other
creeds. Surely that is not un-Christian, far less
anti-Christian. In uniting the East and the West,
in uniting Asiatic and European faith and character,
the Church of the New Dispensation works faithfully
upon the lines laid down by Christ, and only
seeks to amalgamate the Western Christ and the
Eastern Christ. It is not a treaty of Christ with
anti-Christ that is proposed, but the reconciliation of
all in Christ. It is not the mixture of purity with
impurity, of truth with falsehood, of light with darkness,
but the fusion of all types of purity, truth, and
light in all systems of faith into one integral whole.
It is the expurgation of anti-Christian elements from
the so-called Christian and heathen creeds of the
world, and the amalgamation of the pure Christian
residuum left. Such is the pure Christian electicism
of the Church of the New Dispensation.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Men of the type of Rammohun Roy could not,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>and did not, shut their eyes to the superiority of
Christianity from an ethical point of view. They
despised in their heart the idols, as worshipped by
the vulgar, they saw through the pretensions of their
priests, and had long learnt to doubt the efficacy of
their sacrifices. But their social institutions were
so intimately interwoven with their religion that it
required no small amount of moral courage openly
to break with it, and to lose caste, that is, to become
estranged from all relations, friends, and acquaintances.
But while they clearly perceived that their
religion was behind the time, and, as a social institution,
could not stand long against Christianity, they
were by no means inclined to admit that from
a philosophical point of view also it was inferior
to Christianity. Then was the time when Christianity
might have stepped forth in its strong
armour and gained its greatest victories in India.
Rammohun Roy and his friends were ready. He
himself spoke with the greatest humility of the
ancient Hindu religion; nay, in conversations with
his English friends, he used language far too
depreciatory, as it seems to me, of the religious
and philosophical inheritance of India. Then was
the time to act, but there were no Christian ambassadors
to grasp the hands that were stretched
out. Such missionaries as were in India then,
wanted unconditional surrender and submission, not
union or conciliation. In many cases they were
themselves fettered by superstitions which men of
the type of Rammohun Roy had long discarded.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>We keep religion and philosophy in different compartments,
while with men such as Rammohun Roy
the two were one, and the religion of the Veda led
naturally on to the philosophy of the Vedânta, which
became in turn the firm foundation of their religion.
The Vedânta philosophy was so broad that it could
well have served as a common ground for religions so
different as Hinduism and Christianity undoubtedly
are, both in the form of <i>Gñ</i>âna (knowledge) and
of Bhakti (devotion). Rammohun Roy went so
far that, when he was in England, it was doubtful
whether he, in his mind a Vedântist, was not in
his heart a Christian. He spoke with the highest
respect and enthusiasm of Christianity, he carefully
studied the New Testament, and he willingly joined
in Christian worship. Though after his death the
Brâhmanic thread was found on his breast, this does
not prove that he would not have been willing to
surrender that also, if he had met with a real
response from his Christian friends on more important
subjects. We shall see that some of his
followers surrendered even that outward badge of
Brâhmanism, but they could not surrender that
ineradicable belief in the substantial identity of the
eternal element in God and in man. A man like
Athanasius might easily have brought them to call
this consubstantiality the divine sonship of man, if
that expression had been fully explained to the
Vedântists. But no one was there, nay, no one
seems even now bold enough to speak out, and
to separate the vital kernel from the perishable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>crust of religion. That vital kernel was more
clearly seen by Rammohun Roy than by many of
the missionaries who came to convert him. In
Rammohun Roy’s translation of the Upanishads we
can clearly see that in his view of the Deity and of
the relation between the human and the Divine he
had never yielded an inch of his old Hindu convictions,
though his practical religion was saturated
with Christian sentiments. The same mixture of
Christian and Hindu thoughts and Christian sentiments
may be seen in nearly all the recent reformers
of the ancient Hindu religion. The history of these
attempted reforms has been so often written that
I need not enter more fully into it, beyond repeating
my conviction that great opportunities were
lost then for planting Christianity on the old and
fertile soil of India.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to Keshub Chunder Sen he was more of
a true Christian than many who call themselves
Christians, and who are Christians in the ordinary
sense of the word. And he knew it and did not
deny it. Only he thought that Christianity should
not be confined to a small sect, but should comprehend
all religions. As Nânak had declared that
what was wanted was a religion in which there were
all religions, Keshub Chunder Sen also held that
Jesus and Moses, Chaitanya and Buddha, Mohammed
and Nânak should all become one before God.
His New Dispensation was to embrace and unify
all religions, all scriptures, and all prophets in God,
and India was to be the birth-place of that all-embracing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>religion, because it was the birth-place of
the Vedic and the Buddhist religions, and the meeting-place
of Christianity and Islam. In one of the last
numbers of the “New Dispensation,” the organ of
the followers of Keshub Chunder Sen, we read:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Who rules India? What power is that which
sways the destinies of India at the present
moment? You are mistaken if you think that
it is the ability of Lord Lytton in the cabinet or
the military genius of Sir Frederick Haines in the
field that rules India. It is not politics, it is not
diplomacy that has laid a firm hold of the Indian
heart. It is not the glittering bayonet nor the fiery
cannon of the British army that can make our people
loyal. No. None of these can hold India in subjection.
Armies never conquered the heart of a
nation. Muscular force and prowess never made
a man’s head and heart bow before a foreign power.
No. If you wish to secure the attachment and
allegiance of India, it must be through spiritual
influence and moral suasion. And such indeed has
been the case in India. You cannot deny that your
hearts have been touched, conquered, and subjugated
by a superior power. That power need I tell
you—is Christ. It is Christ who rules British India,
and not the British Government. England has
sent out a tremendous moral force in the life and
character of that mighty prophet, to conquer and
hold this vast empire. None but Jesus ever
deserved this bright, this precious diadem, India,
and Jesus shall have it.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Is it not time to lay hold of these outstretched
hands, and not reject them any longer with a cold
<i>non possumus</i>?</p>

<p class='c006'>After Rammohun Roy’s death there was a pause,
for nothing moves in India without a leader, and,
though there were followers of the enlightened
Râjah, there was for a time no leader of sufficient
strength to inspire enthusiasm and to command
respect. What happens generally to religious reformers
happened in India also. They all agreed
in wishing for reform in general, but when it came
to settling special reforms, some of no importance
whatever, they soon diverged in different directions.</p>

<p class='c006'>Those who are acquainted with the Vedas, I
mean with the hymns and Brâhma<i>n</i>as, find it hard to
understand how people of enlightened intellect could
have hesitated for years and years before deciding
against their revealed character. These hymns are
not only old, they are antiquated and effete, they have
no right, like megatheria of old, to hover about in
the strata in which we live. We are ready to give
them a place of honour in our museums, but we
cannot allow ourselves to be swayed by them any
longer. This may seem a harsh judgment, especially
as coming from one who has devoted the best years
of his life to the publication of the Rig-Veda, and
who certainly has never regretted having done so,
as little as he would regret having been the first to
unearth the bones of the oldest of all megatheria, or
the ruins of Babylon or Nineveh. I am not unaware
that there are sparks of profound truth in some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>of the Vedic hymns, but they form a small portion
only of that large collection, and have been brought
into focus in the Upanishads and in the Vedânta-Sûtras.
With these neither Rammohun Roy nor
Keshub Chunder Sen nor Mozoomdar would be
willing to part, but to break with anything called
Veda was by no means an easy task, even for men
of enlightened minds, nor can there be any doubt
that the surrender when it took place at last, involved
an enormous sacrifice. All that Keshub
himself tells us in one of his Lectures is that there
was a terrible strife, the strife of conscience against
associations of mind and place; duty against prepossessions;
truth against cherished convictions.
But conscience triumphed over all; the Vedas were
thrown overboard by Babu Debendranâth Tagore;
and the Brâhma-Samâj bade farewell to their Bible.
This step was particularly painful, because all these
struggles had to go on before the eyes of foreign
observers. In their controversies with the advocates
of Christianity, who claimed all the privileges of a
revelation for their own Bible, the invariable answer
of men like Rammohun Roy had been for a long
time “that the Veda also had for thousands of years
been considered as divinely inspired.” And who
could prove that it was not? Arguments in support
of the revealed character of the Veda were quickly
at hand, for they had been carefully prepared by
the ancient theologians of India. And, if the truth
must be told, the ideas which missionaries connected
with revelation were mostly not very different from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>those familiar to the Brâhmans. “What argument is
there,” the Indian apologists asked, “in support of
the revealed character of your New Testament which
is not equally applicable to the Vedas?” The Buddhists
had already said the same to the Brâhmans,
though for the sake of argument only, hundreds
of years before. “If your Kapila is inspired,”
they said, “why not our Buddha?” In the same
spirit the Brâhmans now said, “If your Christian
revelation is claimed as infallible, why should not
the Vedic revelation be the same?” The fact was
that on one side, as well as on the other, the idea
of revelation had lost its original and true meaning;
had become purely mechanical, a mere name to
conjure with. But the more revelation had become
something miraculous in the eyes of the people of
India, the more creditable was it that the members
of the Brâhma-Samâj, founded by Rammohun Roy,
after becoming better acquainted with their own
sacred writings than they ever had been before,
should solemnly have declared in the year 1850,
that the claim of being divinely inspired could no
longer be maintained in favour of the hymns and
Brâhma<i>n</i>as of the Veda. I know of no other
instance in the whole history of religions that equals
the honesty and self-denial of the members of the
Brâhma-Samâj in their throwing down and levelling
the ramparts of their own fortress, and opening the
gates wide for any messengers of truth. Their
honesty will appear all the more creditable when
we remember that they were by no means inclined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>to discard the Vedas altogether, but only declared
that reverence for the Deity prevented them from
claiming any longer anything like divine workmanship
or penmanship for the whole of it. It is a
pity that we know so little of the mental struggles
through which men like Keshub Chunder Sen and
his friends had to pass before they could bring
themselves to let go the chief anchor of their
religious faith. But Hindus keep their agonies to
themselves. No doubt they lose thereby much
of that human sympathy which we feel for others
who lay open their inmost hearts before us, while
slowly surrendering their old for a new, a purer,
and a better faith. It is very rare that we are
allowed an insight into the home-life and heart-life
of eminent Hindus. The female members of
their families, the mothers, wives, and sisters, who
with us take often so prominent a place in religious
struggles, are excluded from our sight altogether.
But we know that in India also their influence as
mothers and wives is very great. I have several
times heard from my more enlightened friends in
India that they would like to come to England, or
would like to do this or that, but that they shrink
from offending their wives or mothers. Women in
India, ignorant as they may be, wield great power
in their own homes, and it is a common saying that
it is easier to defy H. M.’s Secretary of State than
to defy one’s own mother-in-law. Though mothers
and wives are much less enlightened than their
husbands and sons, it is for that very reason that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>they feel the apostasy of their beloved all the
more deeply. It is everywhere a more severe trial
for a woman than for a man to lose caste, and to
lose caste means more in India than it does with us.
When now and then we catch a glimpse of what
is going on in the sanctuary of an Indian home,
we learn that human nature is the same everywhere.
Thus we read of the old mother of Keshub Chunder
Sen, who must have felt her son’s discarding of his
old religion very keenly, standing by his deathbed
and lamenting that she, poor sinner, should be left
behind, while the dearest jewel of her heart was
being plucked away from her! And the dying one
answers, “Don’t say so, dear mother. All that is
good in me I have inherited from you; all that
I call my own is yours.” So saying, he took the
dust of her feet and put it upon his head.</p>

<p class='c006'>When Keshub Chunder Sen arrived in England,
he was received with open arms, particularly by the
Unitarians. Wherever he spoke or preached, he
attracted immense audiences, and his command of
the English language, nay his real eloquence produced
a deep impression on the religious public
in London and elsewhere. I regretted that there
was no opportunity of his addressing the young
men when he came to Oxford. I was very anxious
also that Dr. Pusey should see him, and the kind-hearted
old Doctor, friendly as he always was to
me, was willing to receive him and to hear what
he had to say. Though Dr. Pusey was a scholar,
and, as such, above many of the prejudices of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>followers, he was not particularly pleased with the
speeches made by Keshub Chunder Sen, nor was
his close relation with the Unitarians to his theological
taste. Still he received him with friendly
sympathy, and some very serious questions of
religion were discussed by the two men with great
freedom. I never kept memoranda even of such
important meetings and discussions at which I happened
to be present. I thought they would remain
engraved on my memory. But now, after the lapse
of so many years, I find that it is not so. I have
indeed the general impression remaining in my
mind, but I cannot trust myself to repeat the
actual words that passed, and it would not be fair
to give what one thinks was said by such men as
Dr. Pusey and Keshub Chunder Sen, when brought
face to face, as if it were what was actually said by
them. In conversation I have often repeated what
passed between them, and this very repetition is
apt to mislead a poor memory like my own. I know
I cannot trust it as to minute details. I remember,
however, very distinctly, how at the end of their
conversation, the question turned up, whether those
who were born and bred as members of a non-Christian
religion could be saved. Keshub Chunder
Sen and myself pleaded for it, Dr. Pusey held his
ground against us. Much of course depended on
what was meant by salvation, and Keshub defined
it as an uninterrupted union with God. “My
thoughts,” he said, “are never away from God;”
and he added, “my life is a constant prayer, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>there are but few moments in the day when I am
not praying to God.” This, uttered with great
warmth and sincerity, softened Dr. Pusey’s heart.
“Then you are all right,” he said, and they parted
as friends, both deeply moved.</p>

<p class='c006'>I must say for Dr. Pusey, much as I differed
from his views, and much as I regretted some of
the steps he took at Oxford, where his influence for
a time was very great, he always tolerated me, and
befriended me on different occasions. We had a
common ground as scholars, and whenever I seemed
to go too far for him, I well remember his looking
up to the clouds and saying, “Oh, I see you are
a German still.” When my friends first submitted to
the Delegates of the University Press at Oxford my
plan of publishing, whether at Oxford or at Vienna,
translations of all the Sacred Books of the East,
Dr. Pusey, being a Delegate and a very influential
Delegate, strongly supported my plan, only stipulating
that the Old and New Testaments should not
be included. In vain did I explain to him that these
two books could never have a better setting than in
the frame formed by the other Sacred Books, and
my firm conviction that the time would come when
the gap thus left would be greatly regretted; but he
remained unshaken. I had to give up a wish that
was very near to my heart in order to save the rest,
but I still hope that hereafter these two, the most
important of the Sacred Books of the East, will
find their proper place in my collection. Nothing
will serve better to show the difference between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>these and the rest of the Sacred Books, and to
make us see both what they share in common with
the rest, and what it is that has given to them the
overwhelming influence which they have exercised
on the highest destinies of the human race.</p>

<p class='c006'>When Keshub Chunder Sen was staying with me
at Oxford, I had a good opportunity of watching
him. I always found him perfectly tranquil, even
when most in earnest, and all his opinions were
clear and settled. He never claimed any merit
for the sacrifices he had made, he rather smiled
at what was past, and seldom complained of his
opponents, except when they accused him of having
been a traitor to his own cause by allowing his
daughter to be betrothed and married to the Mahârâjah
of Kuch Behar, before she had reached, by
a few months, the marriageable age which he and
his friends had themselves fixed for all members
of the Brâhma-Samâj. This is too long and too
complicated a story to be told here; but, whether
the father had shown any paternal weakness or not,
there was surely no cause for his former friends
to separate from him on so paltry a ground, to
insult him and to break his heart, and in the end
to produce a fatal schism in the Brâhma-Samâj.
When Keshub Chunder Sen introduced new reforms,
surrendering the Vedas, abandoning the Brâhmanic
thread, sanctioning widow marriages, and forbidding
child-marriages, his society, hitherto called the
Brâhma-Samâj, assumed the new name of the
Brâhma-Samâj of India (1861), while the more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>conservative Brâhmas<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c017'><sup>[6]</sup></a> under Debendranâth Tagore,
were distinguished by the name of Âdi Brâhma-Samâj,
or the first Brâhma-Samâj. Those who later
on separated again from Keshub Chunder Sen,
because they disapproved of the marriage of his
daughter, and objected to his claiming, or seeming
to claim for himself the gift of inspiration and
a higher authority than was right for any human
being, assumed the new name of Sadhâra<i>n</i>a Brâhma-Samâj
or the Catholic Society of Brâhmas. These
different sections carry on the same work, each in
its own way. Some see in these divisions signs
of healthy vitality, others regret them, as impeding
the more rapid advance of a powerful army. The
points of difference are so few and so insignificant
that it only requires a strong arm to weld them
together once more. Protâp Chunder Mozoomdar
seemed pointed out for this, and it is to be hoped that
he may still succeed in the great work of conciliation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many of those who bore the burden of the day,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>and without whose ready help Keshub Chunder
Sen would hardly have been able to achieve what
he did achieve in his short life, are by this time
dead and forgotten. Even Debendranâth Tagore’s
constant help and patronage are seldom recognised
as they deserve to be in the history of the Brâhma-Samâj.
The memory of Hurrish Chunder Mookerjee
has lately been revived by the republication of his
Three Lectures on Religious Subjects (Calcutta,
1887); and it was his recent death (August, 1898)
that reminded the friends of India of the sacrifices
made by Râmtonoo Lahari and others in support
of the reforms initiated by Rammohun Roy.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>Râmtonoo Lahari.</h3>

<p class='c012'>Râmtonoo<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c017'><sup>[7]</sup></a> was born in 1813, and must therefore
have been older than Debendranâth Tagore, who is
generally considered as the Nestor of the Brâhma-Samâj.</p>

<p class='c006'>He was a pupil of David Hare, who had undertaken
the philanthropic work of educating native
youths, and after spending a few years at his school,
he was admitted into the Hindu College at Calcutta,
which was established in 1817 as the first fruit of
the annual vote of £10,000 for educational purposes
insisted on by the English Parliament. The teacher
who chiefly influenced the young men was D. Rozario,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>who, though branded by the clergy as an infidel
and as a devil of the Thomas Paine school, was
worshipped by his pupils as an incarnation of
goodness and kindness. It was Christian morality,
as preached by D. Rozario, that appealed most
strongly to the heart of Râmtonoo and his fellow-pupils,
many of them very distinguished in later
life, the fathers and grandfathers of the present
generation of Indian reformers. Râmtonoo became
a model among his friends in all matters pertaining
to morality and conscience, penitence and
sincerity being the watchwords of his early career,
vice and hypocrisy the constant objects of his denunciation,
both among his equals and among those
of higher rank and authority. Even the founder
of the Brâhma-Samâj did not escape his reproof,
on account of what he considered want of moral
courage to act up to his convictions. As to himself,
he denounced caste as a great social and moral
evil, and silent submission to superstitious customs
as reprehensible weakness. In order to shame
those who denounced beef-eating as sinful, he and
his friends would actually parade the streets with
beef in their hands, inviting the people to take it
and eat it. The Brâhmanical thread which was
retained by the members of the Brâhma-Samâj as
late as 1861, was openly discarded by him as early
as 1851. And we must remember that in those
days such open apostasy was almost a question of life
or death, and that Rammohun Roy was in danger
of assassination in the very streets of Calcutta. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>true that European officials respected and supported
Râmtonoo, but among his own countrymen he was
despised and shunned. However, he continued his
career undisturbed by friend or foe, and guided by
his own conscience only. Poor as he was, he
desired no more than to earn a small pittance as
a teacher in public and private schools. Later in
life he was attracted to the new Brâhma-Samâj, and
became a close friend of Keshub Chunder Sen.
When he saw others who spent much time in
prayer he considered them as the most favoured
of mortals, for pure and conscientious as he was,
he felt himself so sinful that he could but seldom
utter a word or two in the spirit of what he considered
true prayer before the eyes of the Lord.
While cultivating his little garden he was found
lost in devotion at the sight of a full-blown rose,
and while singing a hymn in adoration of God, his
whole countenance seemed to beam with a heavenly
light. One of his friends tells us that one morning
early he rushed into his room like a madman
and dragged him out of bed, saying that when the
whole nature was ablaze with the light and fire
of God’s glory, it was a shame to lie in bed. He
took the sleeper to the next field, and pointing
his fingers to the rising sun and the beautiful trees
and foliage, he recited with the greatest rapture—what?
Not a hymn of the Veda, but some verses
from Wordsworth. When his end approached, his
old friend Debendranâth Tagore went to take leave
of him, and when he left him, he cried: “Now the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>gates of heaven are open to you, and the gods are
waiting with their outstretched arms to receive you
to the glorious region.” Did the old Vedântist
really say “the gods”? I doubt it, unless he used
the language of Mâyâ, as we also do sometimes,
knowing that his friend would interpret it in the right
sense. I see, however, that Mozoomdar also speaks
of his spirit reposing in his God—showing how the
old habits of thought and old words cling to us
and never lose their meaning altogether.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many more names might be mentioned, but to
us they would hardly be more than names. Debendranâth
Tagore is the only one left who could give
us a history of that important religious movement
in India, and of the principal actors in it. But he is
too old now to undertake such a task. The others,
to use the language of their friends, have, like
the stars that rise in the Eastern sky, after completing
their appointed journey, sunk below the
visible horizon of death, to pass from the hemisphere
of time to that of eternity! But though their names
may be forgotten, their good works will remain, for
“Good deed,” as they say in India, “never dies.”</p>

<h3 class='c013'>Dayânanda Sarasvatî.</h3>

<p class='c012'>One more Samâj should be mentioned here to
prevent confusion, namely, the Ârya-Samâj. This
movement, which was inaugurated by another man,
of the name of Dayânanda Sarasvatî, was proclaimed
as a revival of the ancient Vedic religion.
Dayânanda held fast to his belief in the Veda as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>a divine revelation, though he understood by Veda
the hymns only, and admitted that the Brâhma<i>n</i>as
showed clear traces of human workmanship. The
followers of Dayânanda are quite aware that the
Vedas were composed long before the art of writing
was discovered in India, and they strongly object
to the Veda being styled book-revelation, which
they evidently consider as an inferior kind of revelation.
They say, what they have no doubt learnt
from European scholars, that the Vedas were not
received in the form of books, but were revealed
to the four principal Rishis. But their antagonists
of the Brâhma-Samâj rejoin that, because the Vedas
were committed to paper only a few thousand years
back, it does not follow that they do not partake
of the nature of book-revelation. They ask point
blank whether Dayânanda and his followers believe
that the very words and combinations of words
forming the hymns of the Vedas as we now find
them in MSS. were uttered by God Himself? As
long as they hold to this belief, the followers of
Keshub Chunder Sen accuse them of being believers
in book-revelation, quite as much as if they held
that the bound volumes of the Veda had tumbled
down from heaven. Their discussions on that point
are often very ingenious, and may prove instructive
even to our own apologists. Dayânanda himself
and his followers disclaim any indebtedness to
Western ideas, and they have gained many adherents,
chiefly on the ground that, though pervaded
by a reforming spirit, their Samâj has always remained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>thoroughly national. Dayânanda denounced
idolatry and polytheism, he even repudiated caste,
and allowed widow marriages. This required great
courage, but, being a liberal-conservative, he was
naturally attacked both by liberals, for not going
far enough, and by conservatives, for going too
far. His followers believe that he was actually
poisoned by his enemies. I am told that, at present,
this revival of the ancient national religion has
gained and is gaining far more support in India
than the reforms initiated by Rammohun Roy and
Keshub Chunder Sen. National feelings are strong
in religious matters also. But though his doctrines
may be more popular, there is more real vitality,
more real reasonableness in the ideas of the other
Brâhma-Samâjes. If they would only combine
under a strong leader, they would, I believe, soon
carry with them the wavering followers of Dayânanda;
for in India whoever has once taken the
first step, and surrendered his belief in the revealed
character of even a part of the Veda, will easily
be driven to take another step and adopt human
reason as the only guide to human truth.</p>

<p class='c006'>We know little of the personal character of
Dayânanda, and what we know sounds very apocryphal.
Though I was told soon after his death
that he had been poisoned by the Brâhmans, who
were afraid of his sweeping social reforms, I am
now told by an Indian friend of mine that it
is supposed that his death was caused by the
dancing-girls who, at the instigation of Dayânanda,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>had been placed under strict <i>surveillance</i> by the
Mahârâjah of Jayapura. Their stipends had been
stopped, and they are supposed to have enticed a
young Brâhman cook to poison their enemy. The
cook is said to have afterwards committed suicide.
This though only a rumour among rumours, would
certainly put a different aspect on Dayânanda’s sudden
death. He must have been a powerful man, and
he knew how to be a leader of men. His ignorance
of English deprived him of much that would have
been helpful to him, and would have kept him
from some of his wild ideas about the Veda. He
maintained that all wisdom was to be found in it,
down to the discovery of the power of steam and
its application to steam engines for railways; and
this thousands of years <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>! He was still more
unfortunate in falling, for a time, an easy prey to
Madame Blavatsky’s spiritual fascinations.</p>

<p class='c006'>For some time he understood her as little as she
understood him, and that is saying a good deal.
But when at last they came to understand each
other, there followed a breach that could never be
healed. The life of Dayânanda, published under
the authority of the so-called Theosophists, which
I accepted formerly as genuine, has been discredited,
and we shall probably never have a real biography
of the man, for biography in India seems to share
the fate of history; either it tells us nothing, or
what it tells us is fact and fiction so mixed together
that it is impossible to separate the one from the
other.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>We can see clearly, however, that a strong and
healthy fermentation is going on in the religious
life of India, and if we consider the geographical
extent of that country and the influence that it has
always exercised on the intellectual atmosphere of
the East, we can hardly treat that religious movement,
which was inaugurated by Rammohun Roy,
as indifferent to ourselves. What is wanting in it
at present is the personal element, which is always
very important in India. People are ready to be
led, but they expect a leader to lead them.</p>

<p class='c006'>I should never have understood the real motives
and the true objects of these Indian reformers but
for my personal intercourse with Dvârkanâth, years
ago, and more recently with Keshub Chunder Sen.
Though I did not know Rammohun Roy personally,
I knew several of his friends who had known him at
Bristol, and though I had no personal intercourse
with Dayânanda, I learnt something of him also
from some of his personal friends and followers.
Still, we want to know a great deal more of the
chief actors in a reformation which affects a far
larger number of human beings than did the Reformation
when it reinvigorated the whole of Europe
in the sixteenth century. Some of the questions
now being agitated in India are just the same as
the questions which led in the end to the reformation
of our own Church. If with us the chief
question was that of the authority of the Bible
replacing that of Pope and Councils, with them it
is the authority of the Vedas. And if it was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>first printed edition of the Greek New Testament
by Erasmus that gave the strongest impulse to
our Reformation, it was the first printed edition of
the Veda that gave the most powerful incentive
and the strongest weapon to the founders of the
Brâhma-Samâj in India. Let us hope that India
may be spared a Thirty Years’ War before it can
consolidate the work so courageously begun by
Rammohun Roy, and so valiantly carried on by
my departed friend, Keshub Chunder Sen.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may very naturally be asked, but what is to
become of the religion of India, and more particularly
of the religion of Keshub Chunder Sen
and his friends and followers, after the very foundation
of their ancient faith has been withdrawn, or,
at all events, has been deprived of its sacred and
infallible character? What would become of us if,
say, by the discovery of ancient papyri in Egypt,
it were suddenly placed beyond the reach of reasonable
doubt that the Old and the New Testaments
had been composed by some well-known Rabbi or
philosopher in Egypt? Keshub Chunder Sen himself
might have thought that all was gained after
the heavy incubus of the Vedas had once been
removed from his conscience; but some even of
his best friends thought, not unnaturally, that all
was lost. The idea that whatever truth was contained
in the Vedas remained the same, whether
with or without supernatural credentials, and that
its acceptance without any such credentials required
even a greater amount of honest conviction or faith
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>than its acceptance on the ground of an assurance
of its superhuman authorship, and that assurance
given by human individuals like ourselves, seems
never to have been entertained by the former
believers in the Veda. To most of us the Bible
would probably remain the same, whoever might
be proved to have written it. But it was not so,
as far as I can see, with the members of the
Brâhma-Samâj. And yet it was felt that their
Samâj or Church, if it was to strike root, required
some kind of sacred code after the momentous
decision had been taken to give up the Vedas. It
must not be supposed that these reformers were
without religion; on the contrary, they had more
of the true religious spirit in them than those
from whom they differed and from whom they had
separated; and it was only the strength of their
religious convictions that emboldened them to throw
away their crutches and to stand without any intermediary,
whether human or divine, before the
highest object of their faith and veneration.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first step they took was to explore some of
the great religions of the world, and to select from
their sacred books the most important and most
convincing passages. This was very carefully done
by Keshub Chunder Sen himself, but this international
Bible failed to appeal to the hearts of
the people of India. In religion anything that is
not homegrown, or has become familiar to us
from our childhood, cannot easily be divested of
a strange and almost grotesque sound. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>Bishop Colenso published an English translation
of a beautiful prayer addressed to Vish<i>n</i>u, it produced
nothing but merriment among his English
readers, and why? Because Vish<i>n</i>u was addressed
in it by his well-known popular name of Hari, and
the invocation “O Harry” was too much for the
risible muscles of John Bull.</p>

<p class='c006'>The same effect was produced on the Hindus
when they were told of a God that had made the
world in six days, and rested the seventh day, or
when they heard Christ invoked as <i>Agnus Dei</i>, or
Vatsa Devasya. Language is a very important
element in religion, and the slightest incongruity
is sometimes fatal. It is well known that
Dr. Arnold had to part with an excellent French
master at Rugby simply because he had spoken
of the Holy Ghost as a pigeon, instead of a dove.
The boys could never forget or forgive it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then there was also the national sentiment, which
asserts itself, even when it seems to be most out
of place. The people of India wanted to have
a national religion, and they did not see why they
should have to borrow their prayers from Jews,
Christians, Parsis, or other infidels. I strongly
advised Keshub Chunder Sen, when he was staying
with me at Oxford, to have a good translation made
of the New Testament in Sanskrit, and in the more
important vernaculars of India, only leaving out the
historical passages, which conveyed no meaning to
the large masses of the people in India, and any
other chapters or verses which he considered inappropriate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>for influencing the Indian mind. Keshub
himself was quite ready to adopt such a course, for
he was really in his heart a true follower of Christ.
Once when I had asked him why he did not declare
himself publicly a Christian, he said, in a very
grave and thoughtful tone, “Suppose that thirty
years hence people find out that I was a disciple
of Christ, what would be the harm? Only were
I to profess myself a Christian now, all my influence
would be gone at once.” Whether any steps were
taken by Keshub to carry out the idea of a New
Testament for India I cannot tell. Something of
the same kind had been done in English by
Rammohun Roy himself. The book has become
very scarce, and I doubt whether it ever influenced
even his own followers.</p>

<p class='c006'>Debendranâth Tagore, the paternal friend of
Keshub Chunder Sen, adopted a different course.
He would never declare against the whole Veda, but,
discarding the hymns and the Brâhma<i>n</i>as, he made
a careful selection of important passages from the
Upanishads, and published them, with an explanation
in Sanskrit, under the title of “Brâhma-dharma,”
the Law of the Brâhmas. This became for a time
the new guide of the Brâhmas, even before Keshub
Chunder Sen published his selections from the
Bibles of the world, and will probably in time
become their Bible, or at all events their Book of
Meditations. The primitive religious doctrines
of the Upanishads were reduced to an elaborate
system of philosophy by Bâdarâya<i>n</i>a, probably long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>before the Christian era, though after the rise of
Buddhism (fifth century), under the title of Vedânta-Sûtras,
and a most wonderful system it is, though
difficult to describe in a few pages. It is generally
supposed that the Vedânta philosophy denies the
reality of the whole world. But this is not so; it
only declares, and even more consistently than we
do, that the world is phenomenal. It is not what
it seems to be, but it would not even seem to be,
unless it reposed on the Divine, which alone is
really real. That Divine, in order to be what it
is, or what it ought to be conceived to be, must,
according to the Vedânta, be free from all limitation,
it must therefore be one, with nothing beside it, it
must be subjective, not objective or perceptible by
the senses, devoid therefore of all qualities. But,
instead of calling the world a mere nothing, the old
Vedântists held, on the contrary, that there could be
nothing objective or phenomenal, unless there was
something real beneath it, in comparison with which
anything else might be called unreal, that is, phenomenal.
Thus, even our unreal world could not
exist unless there was at the back of it a something
real; and, if we claim any reality for ourselves,
we can only do so after surrendering all that is
phenomenal in ourselves, all that is changing,
perishing, and mortal. Only then can we find and
recover our true being, where alone it can be
found, namely in the divine, invisible, but ever-present,
absolute Power, the uncreate, the eternal
and never-changing Being whom we call God. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>was that ultimate Reality which they called Brahman,
and this was, in fact, but another name for
what European philosophers have called the Ultimate,
the Unknowable, the Great Reality, the
Hidden, the Abyss, the Silence, the Fullness, the
Eternal Life—names all meaning the same, or
meant for the same, though powerless to reach
what is beyond the reach of words.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then came the very natural question, whence
comes the change from the Real to the Phenomenal,
or what we call the creation? Whence the phenomenal
in place of the noumenal world? The
Vedânta answer is, From Nescience. This has been
called the weak, the human, the vulnerable point
in the Vedânta; but we should remember that, in
some shape or other, that vulnerable point can never
be absent from any system of philosophy. I doubt
whether there are many founders of philosophies
who have disguised it better than Bâdarâya<i>n</i>a and
his predecessors in the Upanishads. Nescience,
they say, is neither real nor unreal. It is, but it
cannot be called real, because it can be destroyed,
and is to be destroyed by Vidyâ, science, i.e. the
Vedânta philosophy; yet it cannot be called unreal,
for we see its effects in all the phenomenal world.
This nescience must not be taken for the ignorance
of the individual man, or for his unacquaintance with
the Vedânta philosophy. It is something inherent
in human nature. Brahman itself is affected by it
indirectly, but not directly. Brahman, as conceived
by us, may be said to be for a time under its sway.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>A power such as this nescience was sure to yield
to the mythopoeic influence of language, and to
become <i>she</i>, as it did under the name of Mâyâ
(illusion, magic), or even of <i>S</i>akti, <i>potentia</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>But whether that impulse which produced the
phenomenal world is called Avidyâ (nescience),
or Mâyâ (illusion), or <i>S</i>akti (<i>potentia</i>), it was and
is the aim of Vidyâ or the Vedânta philosophy
to dispel it, and thus to destroy the illusion that
there is any real difference between man and Brahman.
It then becomes clear that this phenomenal
world in its endless variety is but an ignorance,
a dream that will pass away, if once our eyes are
opened. Whatever is known by us, becomes, <i>ipso
facto</i>, objective and phenomenal, and to know this
is the first step towards the truth. It may seem
difficult to understand how such a philosophy could
be treated as orthodox, and go hand in hand with
the popular religion. But we must remember that
Brahman, the first and the only real Being, as soon
as perceived or conceived as an object, becomes at
once a phenomenal being. Thus Brahman (neut.)
became to human intelligence Brahmâ (masc.), and
was recognised and worshipped as phenomenalised
under such popular names as <i>S</i>iva, Vish<i>n</i>u, K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a,
and many more. In this way the old mythological
gods had not to be discarded altogether; on the
contrary, devotion to them (Bhakti) was not only
tolerated, but actually enjoined, till true knowledge
or G<i>ñ</i>âna had arisen. <i>S</i>iva and Vish<i>n</i>u and other
gods were accepted as persons or as faces (Pratîka)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>of Brahman. Nay, they were recognised as the
phenomena of Brahman, and whosoever worshipped
them was led to believe that he worshipped Brahman,
though ignorantly. Here lies a wonderful
amount of wisdom, from which even we may have
something to learn; and it is not surprising that some
of these modern Hindu philosophers and religious
teachers should have felt that they had not only to
learn from us, but had something also to teach us.
This may sound very strange to our ears, and yet
what is more natural? Nay, strange as it sounds to
our ears, it is nevertheless a fact, that may have been
exaggerated in the American papers, but that is not
without some real foundation, namely, that some
Vedântist missionaries, such as Vivekânanda, Abhedânanda,
<i>S</i>âradânada, and others, who were sent to
America, are lecturing there before large audiences,
and have actually made some converts who accept
the Vedântic view of the world, and call themselves
Theosophists or Vedântists. These missionaries
are mostly the disciples and followers of a well-known
Indian ascetic, who had spent his life in
preaching Vedântic sentiments, and who died as
late as 1886<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c017'><sup>[8]</sup></a>. Men of that class are well known
in India, and are spoken of as Mahâtmans. They
live as much as possible retired from the world, it
may be in a cave or a small hut in the forest.
They wear hardly anything but rags, bear heat,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>cold, and hunger without complaining, and strive
hard to become Vairâgins, men without any passions
and without any desires. It need hardly be said
that some of them are mere impostors and disreputable
characters, well known to the police. Others,
however, are real religious enthusiasts. Though
they may know a little Sanskrit, they are not the
recognised depositaries of ancient learning; but,
once filled and fired with the spirit of the Vedânta,
they become very eloquent preachers, and gather
crowds around them, willing to drink in the truths
which never fail to exercise their intoxicating power
on the Indian mind. Many of these Mahâtmans
know by long practice how to put themselves into
a real trance, and thus to make people believe that
they have been outside their body or beside themselves,
and have received inspirations from a divine
source. If this is a deception, it is certainly a very
old deception. It is practised by sons, as they had
seen it practised by their fathers, and, as far as
I can see, without any sinister intentions. Râmak<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a
and men of his class are addicted to Bhakti,
devotion or love, rather than to G<i>ñ</i>âna., knowledge,
or pure philosophy. They speak of K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a rather
than of Brahman, nay, Brahman itself becomes with
them Brahmâ, a masculine and active god. If some
of these men declare their perfect willingness to
adopt the religion of Christ, they can do so with
perfect honesty. The God of Christianity, the
Creator of the world, the Father of all the children
of man, would be to them but another name,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>another face or person of the Godhead. Christ
would be to them not simply a manifestation, like
Râma or Nârada, but, from a far higher point of
view, born of God, one with God, having realised
God, as we all are to realise Him in time, in order
to attain real brotherhood with Christ and among
ourselves, and divine sonship, the long forgotten or
forfeited birthright of every son of man. Would
not that be enough to make them Christians, truer
Christians than even some of the missionaries, who
approach them as if they were a degraded race, and
who are often satisfied if they can baptize them,
even without having really converted them? If
we want them to understand us, let us first try to
understand them. If that mutual recognition is
once achieved, there may be a future for Christianity
in store in India such as we hardly venture
to dream of as yet. There are Hindus of the
highest caste who would be able, like the eunuch,
to say with perfect honesty that they believed that
Jesus Christ was the son of God, in the highest
sense of the word. What then hindereth them
from being baptized? No wonder that European
visitors who come to see these devotees in India
should often be repelled by what they see. They
are generally naked, or in rags, with dishevelled
hair, emaciated, and not always very clean. Their
expression is wild and often half crazy. Even their
photographs are enough to frighten us. But for
all that, their utterances, partly their own, partly
echoes of what they have heard, are sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>very powerful and even beautiful, and people of
all classes, educated and uneducated, are willing to
listen to them for hours. One thing is certainly
to their credit. Though they accept alms, they
never ask for them; and even the missionaries who
have travelled all the way to America to lecture and
preach, never ask for money. They do not want it,
and what is given to them is sent to India forthwith
towards a fund for building and endowing what we
should call monasteries, where the style of life is
as simple as it was in the best days of monastic life
in Europe. The sayings of Râmak<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a have
been published by his disciples, and I cannot resist
the temptation of giving here at least a few of
them:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thou seest many stars at night in the sky, but
findest them not when the sun rises. Canst thou
say that there are no stars then in the heaven of
day? O man, because thou beholdest not the
Almighty in the days of thy ignorance, say not
that there is no God.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Different creeds are but different paths to reach
the Almighty.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“As from the same gold various ornaments are
made, having different forms and names, so our
God is worshipped in different countries and ages,
and has different forms and names. Though He
may be worshipped variously, some loving to call
Him Father, others Mother &#38;c., yet it is one God
that is being worshipped in all these various relations
and modes.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>“Man is like a cushion-cover. The colour of one
may be red, another blue, another black, but all
contain the same cotton inside. So it is with man;
one is beautiful, one is black, another holy, a fourth
wicked; but the Divine dwells in all of them.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“God is in all men, but all men are not in God,
that is the reason why they suffer.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“As the lamp does not burn without oil, man
cannot live without God.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There are two egos in man, one ripe and the
other unripe. The ripe ego thinks, ‘Nothing is
mine, whatever I see, or feel, or hear, nay, even
this body is not mine; I am always free and
eternal.’ The unripe ego, on the contrary, thinks,
‘This is my house, my room, my child, my wife,
my body,’ &#38;c.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“When the knowledge of Self is obtained, all
fetters fall off by themselves. Then there is no
distinction of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a or a <i>S</i>ûdra, of high caste
or low caste. In that case the sacred thread, the
sign of caste, falls away of itself. But so long as
man has the consciousness of distinction and difference
of caste, he should not forcibly throw it away.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A man after fourteen years of hard asceticism
in a lonely forest, obtained at last the power
of walking on the waters. Overjoyed at this
acquisition, he went to his teacher and told him
of his great feat. At this the master replied:
‘My poor boy, what thou hast accomplished after
fourteen years of arduous labour, ordinary men do
the same by paying a penny to the boatman.’”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>“Where is God? How can we get at Him?
There are pearls in the sea. One must dive again
and again till one gets at them. So there is God in
the world, but you should persevere in diving.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The vanities of all others may gradually die
out, but the vanity of a saint is hard, indeed, to
wear away.”</p>

<p class='c006'>There are hundreds of such sayings, all breathing
the same spirituality, the same familiarity with the
unseen world. Some of them sound to us trivial
and common, but in publishing them I did not like
to leave out any, for fear of being suspected of
falsifying the record and representing the bright
side of the movement only. To our taste there
may be too much of that familiarity. Silence in
the presence of God seems to us more reverential
than words, but to a man of the character of Râmak<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a,
and I might say, to Hindus in general,
the distance between the human and the Divine,
between God and man, has always been very small,
till at last it seems to vanish altogether. To
their eyes the unseen world and the unseen God
are not unseen. The veil formed by what we call
the flesh is to them so transparent that it often
vanishes altogether. The idea of a distance from
God or of a gradual approach to Him after death
exists indeed in their exoteric philosophy, but to
the true Vedântist such an approach is really
unthinkable. To the Vedântist the highest goal
has always been to have his humanity taken back
into the Godhead, not to put on a new nature,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>but to recover his old and true nature, in fact to
become what, in spite of the dreams and fancies
of life, he has always been. Those who cannot
soar so high, may indeed be allowed to worship
a distant God, nay, to approach His throne reverentially
in another life, and they are taught that
even in that state of mind, they are moving forward
on the right road, the road that may at last bring
them to themselves and make them enjoy the
Divine and the Eternal within them. Hence with
all their strong sense of the imperfections of this
life, with the acknowledgment of their guilt and
their consequent separation from God, they never
use the disparaging language of other religions
which seems to make man the most contemptible
worm on earth. No doubt, they also have imagined
a number of beings intermediate between God and
man, but when these creatures of their own fancy
have been dissolved again, they seem to feel that in
reality there is no class of real beings that can claim
to fill the self-made gap between God and man.
Râmak<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a himself was still in the bonds of the
popular faith of India. He worshipped the gods
created by man, such as Vish<i>n</i>u, <i>S</i>iva, and others,
he did not shrink even from offering sacrifices to
idols, but he felt and saw that behind them there
is the inexpressible Essence which is more than any
or all of them. The purely human devotion and
love which he expresses for his Divine Mother, for
instance, is sometimes most startling, but one feels
all the time that, if he could only express it, he is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>groping for that Godhead which he must find in
himself or in his Self before he can find it in the Self
of the whole world, in the Self even of the old idols.
A distant God like the Jewish Jehovah would be no
God at all to the Vedântist, he cannot be too near
to his God; nay, to be without Him but for one
moment would be death and annihilation to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such ideas are no doubt strange to most of us,
but if we cannot as yet make them our own, we
should at all events give Râmak<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a and his
followers credit for holding them honestly.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>MY INDIAN FRIENDS.<br> <br> III.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c011'>Behramji Malabâri.</h3>

<p class='c012'>Intimately connected with the reform of religion
in India were social reforms, such as the education
of women, the recognition of widow marriages, the
fixing of the marriageable age of boys and girls, &#38;c.
The burning of widows or of Suttees, had been boldly
put down by the English Government years ago;
though, as we saw, it was still defended as resting
on Vedic authority by so learned and enlightened
a man as Râdhâkânta Deva. But, though widows
were no longer burnt, their life as widows was in
many cases worse than death. Owing to the system
of very early, and what has been truly called, child-marriages,
the number of child-widows is, and has
been for many years, very large in India; and the
only means of reducing their number was to prohibit
early marriages altogether. The chief actors in
this good work were my friend Behramji Malabâri,
and another dear friend, Râmabâi, both still alive
and hard at work in the good cause. The former
was chiefly bent on preventing these premature
marriages, the latter on taking care of the victims
of that pernicious system. We need not enter here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>on purely physiological questions, for here the
answer is always ready that marriage at the early
age of seven or eight can mean no more than
betrothal. That in the East, men and women are
more precocious in their physical development is an
assertion rather than an established fact. But it is
not the body only, it is the mind that has to be
considered, and what can be the mental condition
of a child-wife of seven, nay, even of fourteen?
How such a system ever sprang up, it is difficult
to say. It was not the old Indian system. It may
have originated at the time of the Mohammedan
conquest, married women being supposed to be
more respected by the conquerors than unmarried
girls. At present its fatal effects are but too clear,
in the premature decay of the women, in the weakness
of their offspring, and, more particularly, in the
large number of child-widows. No wonder therefore
that a man of Malabâri’s patriotism and sense of
duty should have devoted himself body and soul,
and purse too, to the abolition of that evil. Though
there were many to sympathise with him and to
help him, still there was also strong opposition, and
from quarters where one would least have expected
it. Malabâri was a Parsi, and the Hindus did not
like to be lectured by an outsider. If their dirty
linen had to be washed at all, they wished to have
it washed at home by their own washerwomen.
Others, though admitting abuses, gave a most
idyllic picture of the first love of young children,
which extended its blessing over the whole of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>lives, while the European system led to endless
misery, to broken hearts, to divided affections, and
sometimes even to a sundering of ties which in the
eyes of the Hindus can never be sundered.</p>

<p class='c006'>There have been many strong protests from
numbers of well-conducted families in India who
deny altogether that child-widows, or any widows,
are subject to cruel treatment, and who maintain
that early marriages have by no means all the evil
effects which are charged against them. There are
exceptions, no doubt, to everything, but I doubt
whether these exceptions can make up for the
mischief caused by the system of early marriages
as still prevalent in India. And what is there that
can be urged in favour of a system which even
its strongest supporters can only defend as less
monstrous than it appears to be. We are told<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c017'><sup>[9]</sup></a>
that in Bengal a young husband is able to educate
his young wife. That sounds very well. But in
a Hindu family a married child is not supposed
even to see her husband during the daytime, so that
the education, whatever that may mean, could only
take place in the stillness of the night, not the most
propitious time after a day of constant work. We
are likewise told that a child-wife divides her year
in two halves. One of them she spends with her
parents, this being a sort of vacation time, and the
other she spends at the house of her husband’s
parents, this being confessedly the time of daily
drudgery. In well-ordered families the young wife is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>never allowed to live with her husband permanently
till she has reached her fourteenth year.</p>

<p class='c006'>This defence, however, does not amount to much,
and though we may quite believe that in good
families the evils of the system of child-marriage
are very much mitigated, the system itself is unnatural,
full of dangers, and certainly lowering, both
physically and morally, to the mothers of India.</p>

<p class='c006'>The most unexpected defender of child-marriages
appeared in Ânandibâi Joshee, a young Hindu lady
who had gone to America to study medicine, and,
after taking her medical degree at the Women’s
Medical College of Pennsylvania in 1886, was
appointed Physician-in-charge of the Female Ward
of the Albert-Edward Hospital at Kolhapur, and
died in 1887 at the early age of twenty-two. She
was evidently a most enlightened lady, and a great
friend of Râmabâi. But when she had been asked,
in 1884, to lecture on child-marriages, she surprised
her large American audience by defending the
national custom of early marriage. I am sorry
I have never been able to see her lecture, but it
shows at all events that the abolition of that custom
was not so universally desired as it ought to have
been, and by no means so easy in India as it might
appear to us. We are told that the early betrothal
of boys and girls made their mutual affection more
natural and firm, and added the feelings of brother
and sister to those of husband and wife. It was
fondly hoped that under such circumstances the
idea of anybody else ever taking the place of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>first beloved one would be altogether impossible.
Many other arguments were adduced in support
of what seemed a national, time-hallowed, and
almost sacred custom, but they soon crumbled away
at the touch of so well-informed and determined a
man as my friend Malabâri. I do not know how
many voyages he has made to England to insure
sympathy and help. He has spent years in travelling
all over India and gaining support for his crusade.
He has told us that he is a poor man, but whatever
he possessed or gained, he seems to have given up
for the main object of his life. I am quite willing
to believe that in the better families the evil consequences
of premature matrimony are guarded
against, just as I cannot altogether withhold my
belief from those who declare that in good families
child-widows, and in fact all widows, are treated
with sympathy and respect. But without denying
such exceptions, it was the rule or the custom, such
as he knew it to exist, that roused the indignation
of Malabâri. He may be congratulated on having
lived to see some at least of the fruits of his devoted
labours. Assisted by his friends, both native and
English, he carried at last a Bill which fixed the
respective ages of freedom to marry at eighteen
and twelve. This was a decided victory; still the
battle is by no means over, and probably never will
be till the marriageable age of girls is raised at least
to sixteen, and that of boys to twenty. It was
twenty-four in Vedic times. That every kind of
abuse was heaped on Malabâri need not surprise us;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>still his own conscience must tell him that he has
done a real service to millions of human beings, and
removed from his country a slur that had lowered
it in the eyes of all civilised nations. It is highly
creditable to him that he declined all rewards and
honours offered to him at the end of his successful
campaign, and we should not be surprised if we
met him again on the old battlefield, anxious to win
new victories as the defender of a good cause.</p>

<p class='c006'>The number of widows in India is simply appalling.
According to the census of the year 1881
their number of all ages amounted, at that time, to
twenty million nine hundred and thirty thousand
six hundred and twenty-six. Of these six hundred
and sixty-nine thousand one hundred were under
nineteen years of age.</p>

<p class='c006'>Even native states have taken up the cause of
the unhappy children. Some of the Rajput states
some years ago declared against premature marriage,
and Mysore has now followed their good example,
passing a law not only to prevent child-marriages,
but to make it penal for an old man to marry a
young girl. I doubt whether such a law would pass
even our own Parliament. Clause 3 says:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Any person who causes the marriage of a girl
who has not completed fourteen years of age, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>a man who has completed fifty years of age, and
any person who knowingly aids and abets, within
the meaning of the Indian Penal Code, such marriage,
shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a
term which may extend to six months, or with fine,
or with both.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The Madras Presidency will now have to follow
the example of Mysore, instead of taking the lead,
as it ought to have done. In a Memorandum accompanying
the Bill for the Madras Presidency, it is
stated that in 1882 there were 157,466 girls married
under the age of nine, and that there were 5,621
widows under the same age. Think of widows
under nine years of age!</p>

<p class='c006'>In the census of 1891 it was shown that there
were 23,938 girls married in their fourth year and
under, and 142,606 between five and nine years
of age, giving a total of 166,544 girls married under
nine years of age. There were 988 widows of four
years and under, and 4,147 between five and nine
years, making a total of 5,135. In future, however,
the law is never to recognise any widows under
nine years of age, and there is every hope that the
number of these baby-widows will be considerably
reduced as soon as no girl can be betrothed till
she has reached, at least, the age of eight; the
bridegroom being, as a rule, five or six years older.
This is, of course, much too low an age, but it was
considered the least likely to rouse opposition among
the native population, as some of the law-books of
the Hindus are in favour of that age, while they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>actually threaten parents who do not marry their
daughter before ten with the hell called Raurava.
The greatest living legal authorities in India have
declared in favour of a limit of age, fixing it at
eight for girls. As their support gives immense
strength to the aspirations of the reform party, its
leaders have accepted it for the present. Men like
Malabâri are of course not satisfied, yet they may
be proud to have achieved what they have achieved.
They have at all events reduced the number of
possible child-widows, by limiting the marriageable
age of girls to eight. Much more, however, remains
to be done, and Malabâri is not the man to let
sleeping dogs lie. He wields a powerful pen in
English, and he is the best living writer of Guzerathi.
He began life as a Guzerathi poet, but he gave up
poetry and everything else to concentrate all his
energy on his crusade. He has written several
very successful English books, the last being “The
Indian Eye on English Life.” He is the editor of an
influential paper at Bombay, <i>The Indian Spectator</i>.
He has also undertaken to spread my Hibbert
Lectures “On the Origin and Growth of Religion”
all over India, by having them translated into
Sanskrit and every one of the modern languages of
the country. This undertaking also he has carried
through successfully, without flinching from considerable
trouble and pecuniary risk. All these
undertakings require money, and in the present
state of things a willingness to spend money is a
very good, if not the best, test of a man’s sincerity.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>Malabâri has stood that test for many years, and
much as he longs for rest, I learn that he is not
likely to stand by with folded arms, and to leave
the fight to others<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c017'><sup>[10]</sup></a>.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>Râmabâi.</h3>

<p class='c012'>If we admire the boldness and perseverance of
Malabâri, we cannot withhold the same admiration
from a young Indian lady who, though she could
not hope to prevent child-marriages, has done her
very best to ameliorate the lot of the victims of
those unnatural unions.</p>

<p class='c006'>To be a widow at all is hard enough, but nothing
can be more miserable than the lot of a young
widow in India, whose life may be said to be over
before it has begun. Widows are looked upon in
their own homes as beings of evil omen, as having
deserved their misfortune by some unknown misdeeds
in this or, what is worse, in a former life,
and, particularly if childless, they are treated no
better than servants, whether in the house of their
parents-in-law, or even in the house of their real
parents, if they are allowed to return there. They
are shunned, excluded from all amusements, obliged
to wear coarse garments, deprived of their ornaments,
and often condemned to have their heads
shaved, a great indignity in the eyes of every
woman. What a life to look forward to for a girl,
often, it may be, not yet sixteen years old! No
wonder that they should often commit suicide, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>fall still lower by being driven to lead an immoral
life. It is to ameliorate the lot of these unhappy
creatures that Râmabâi has been working for years,
chiefly at Poonah. She is certainly a most courageous
woman, not to be turned away from her
purpose by any misfortunes or any threats.</p>

<p class='c006'>I saw much of her when she stayed with us at
Oxford, but the most eventful part of her career
belonged to an earlier period. With what she told
me then, and what has been published since by
Mrs. R. L. Bodley in the Introduction to Râmabâi’s
account of the “Life of a High-Caste Hindu
Woman” (Philadelphia, 1887), we begin to understand
the high aims of this truly heroic Hindu
lady, in appearance small, delicate, and timid, but in
reality strong and bold as a lioness. Her life, so
far as we know it from herself and from others,
draws away the veil behind which so much that is
really of the deepest interest to us, is hidden in
the East. Here we see first of all from her own
case how carelessly marriages are often arranged
in India. Râmabâi’s grandfather, who belonged to
an old and very illustrious Brâhmanic family, the
Kauthumas, was on a religious pilgrimage with his
family, that is, his wife and two daughters, one
nine, the other seven years of age. One morning,
when bathing in the Godâvarî, he saw a fine-looking
man in the river, and after inquiring for his caste,
his clan, and his home, and finding out that he
was a widower, he offered him his eldest daughter,
that is, a child of nine, in marriage. All things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>being satisfactorily settled in a few hours, the
marriage took place the next day, and the stranger
started with his child-wife for his home, nearly nine
hundred miles away from the child’s own home,
while the father continued his pilgrimage, unconcerned
any longer about the fate of his daughter.
However, the marriage, though we might call it
hasty and imprudent, turned out well, and her
husband, who was a great Sanskrit scholar, a pupil
of Râmachandra <i>S</i>âstri, not only was kind to his
little wife, but was most anxious to teach her the
sacred language. This was a very unusual measure,
in fact, it was against the Brâhmanic law. It seems
that he had made the same experiment with his
first wife, but that it had failed owing to the opposition
of her family. When therefore he was met
by a similar opposition in the case of his second
wife, he suddenly left his home and his friends,
and journeyed with his young wife to the forest
of Gungamul, on a remote plateau of the Western
Ghauts, and there founded his new home, where
the world could no longer hinder or trouble him.
Such things are possible in India only, and even
there they are of rare occurrence. Râmabâi was
told by her mother how she and her husband spent
the first night after their flight from home in the
open air without shelter of any kind, she rolled up
in her pasodi or cotton quilt, he watching by her
side. Wild animals were heard howling all around
them, and the young wife lay convulsed with terror;
and no wonder she did, though her husband kept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>watch till daybreak, frightening the wild animals
away as best he could from his bride and his new
home. However, there, in the forest, husband and
wife, like another Yâ<i>gñ</i>avalkya and Maitreyî, remained,
and there the husband began to teach his
wife Sanskrit. A rude hut was soon constructed,
such as suffices in a forest and in the climate of
India. The wife grew in stature and in knowledge,
and soon became the mother of three children born
in this wilderness, one son and two daughters. As
they grew up the father at once began the instruction
of his son and his elder daughter. Soon the
fame of his scholarship began to attract other
students from the neighbourhood, and the hermitage,
situated as it was near the source of one of the
rivers, became a place of pilgrimage, and attracted
many visitors.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the younger daughter, our Râmabâi, grew
up, the father was getting too old and too weary to
teach her also, so that her education fell chiefly
to the share of her mother, Lakshmâbâi.</p>

<p class='c006'>Soon the household grew, partly by the arrival
of the aged father and mother-in-law, who had to
be taken care of, partly by the arrival of many
pilgrims, who in India have a right to hospitable
entertainment. At last the expenses grew too high,
the little hermitage had to be broken up, and father
and children had to begin a new life, that of a
pilgrim family without any home, wandering about
from place to place, tramping, in fact, as we should
say, and earning a small livelihood by recitations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>whether in palaces or monasteries. When Râmabâi
began her career as a prodigy of learning, she had
learned ever so many Sanskrit texts by heart, either
from her mother or from listening unknown, as she
told me, to the lessons given by her father to her
brother. Erudition in India means learning by
heart. A pupil learns a number of verses every
day and repeats them the next day, constantly
adding new lines, till at last he can repeat thousands
of lines without a hitch. Râmabâi listened at the
door while her brother and other students repeated
their daily lessons, and in this way she learnt in the
end to repeat more lines than most young Brâhmans.
For this she received rewards while travelling
on foot from place to place with her father,
mother, and brother. The elder sister had been
married, though not very happily, it would seem,
while Râmabâi gladly remained unmarried long
after the statutable age. This was really considered
as a breach of the law, but as long as her parents
were alive she had a recognised support in them.
When, however, the father died, and very soon after
the mother also, her position became almost desperate.
She still had her brother, who then became her
natural guardian and protector; but the whole of
the small family property had been spent. There
was not even enough left to pay a few Brâhmans for
carrying the remains of her mother to the burning-ghat,
about three miles distant. At last two Brâhmans
were found who took pity on the bereaved
children, and with their assistance son and daughter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>carried the sacred burden to the place of cremation.
Poor Râmabâi’s low stature compelled her to carry
her share of the dear burden on her head. We can
hardly imagine such a state of things, and such
suffering; yet what seems to us incredible comes
from Râmabâi’s own mouth, and, from what I know
of her, she may be implicitly trusted. When I once
asked her how she knew that she belonged to the
famous Brâhmanic clan of the Kauthumas, she
replied very simply, “But who would ever doubt
it?” And the same remark applies to all that she
has told us of the sufferings of her life.</p>

<p class='c006'>These sufferings were not over yet. She had
now no one to look to but her brother, and without
some male support the life of a single woman is
simply impossible in India. For some years brother
and sister travelled together on foot all over India,
earning what they wanted for their support by their
recitations of Sanskrit texts, and afterwards by lecturing
on the degraded position of women in India.
Arrived in Calcutta Râmabâi’s lectures excited great
interest. But now followed a new blow. Her
brother died, and from sheer necessity she had to
take a husband. The marriage turned out perfectly
happy, but after nineteen months of quiet married
life there followed a new blow. Her husband died,
and she was left a widow with one daughter, whom
she called Manoramâ, or Heart’s Joy.</p>

<p class='c006'>Her case seemed desperate indeed, but she was
upheld by her strong desire to fit herself for useful
work among her own countrywomen. Helpless as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>she was, she resolved to go to England in order to
study medicine. This was a bold decision, and required
more moral courage than Napoleon’s march
to Russia.</p>

<p class='c006'>Member of a high-caste Brâhman family though
she was, the mere prejudice against crossing the
black water would hardly have affected her, but she
was very poor. All she possessed was a small sum
of money which she had earned by her lectures and
by translations done for Government, and how was
she to pay for her passage and to support herself,
her child, and a friend who was to accompany her to
England? But undeterred by any fears she started
with her little daughter and a female friend, and when
she arrived in England, almost destitute, she fortunately
found shelter for a time with the Sisterhood
at Wantage, some members of which she had known
at Poonah. But even then her tragedy was not yet
ended. She had declared to the Sisters that, grateful
as she felt for their kindness, she would never become
a Christian, because, as she often said, a good
Brâhmanî is quite as good as a good Christian.
Her friend, however, was frightened by the idea
that she and Râmabâi would be made Christians by
force; and to save Râmabâi and herself from such
a fate, she tried one night to strangle her. Failing
in that, she killed herself. It was after this terrible
catastrophe at Wantage that Râmabâi came to stay
with us at Oxford, and such was her nervous prostration
that we had to give her a maidservant to
sleep every night in the same room with her. Nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>was this all. After all arrangements had been made
to enable her to attend medical lectures at Oxford,
her hearing became suddenly so much affected that
she had to give up all idea of a medical career.
She then determined to study nursing, and thus fit
herself for useful work in India. Then came an
invitation from America to be present at the conferring
of a medical degree on her countrywoman,
Ânandibâi Joshee, of whom I spoke before, and
being once there, she soon succeeded in gaining
many friends, who helped her to start a refuge or
Âsrama for child-widows in India. This is the work
to which at last she has devoted herself, and with
great success, her only difficulty being that in the
meantime she had, after all, become a Christian and
joined her Christian friends; not that she considered
her former religion false or mischievous, but because,
as she told me, she could no longer stand quite
alone, she wanted to belong to somebody, and particularly
to be able to worship together with those
whom she loved and who had been so kind to her.
Her having become a Christian has, no doubt,
proved a serious obstacle to her success in her
chosen sphere of usefulness in India. Though we
may trust her that she never made an attempt at
proselytising among the little widows committed to
her care, yet how could it be otherwise than that
those to whom the world had been so unkind, and
Râmabâi so kind, should wish to be what their
friend was, Christian! Her goodness was the real
proselytising power that could not be hidden; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>she lost, of course, the support of her native friends,
and has even now to fight her battles alone, in order
to secure the pecuniary assistance necessary for the
support of her little army of child-widows. She is,
indeed, a noble and unselfish woman, and deserves
every help which those who sympathise with her
objects, can afford to give her.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>Ânandibâi Joshee, M.D.</h3>

<p class='c012'>There is another Hindu lady to whom I alluded
before as a friend of Râmabâi’s, who in fact invited
Râmabâi to come to the United States to be present
at her taking her degree of M.D. in the Medical
College of Pennsylvania, and who thus determined,
to a great extent, the future course of Râmabâi’s
life. She too must have been a young heroine, and
it is well that her name should not be forgotten on
the roll of martyrs, who have lived, worked, and died
in the cause of elevating and regenerating their
country. I draw my information chiefly from a
sympathetic article, signed Isabel M. Sullivan, in
the <i>Indian Social Reformer</i>, July 10, 1898. Ânandibâi
was different from Râmabâi in one respect.
Though free from many prejudices, she remained
a true Brâhmani through life. She fearlessly stood
by Râmabâi after her husband’s death, and even
offered her the shelter of her home. She remained
her faithful friend to the end, which took place in
1887, when she was only twenty-two years of age.
Though she could not bring herself to go quite so
far as Râmabâi in giving up the religion of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>childhood, her enthusiasm took another, yet very
perilous form. She had seen the untold physical
sufferings of girls and women in India, who are
almost entirely left to the medical care of uneducated
<i>femmes sages</i> and inefficient nurses. But for a young
girl of eighteen, brought up in the narrowly guarded
sphere of an Indian home, to dream of leaving her
country, to travel to America, and enter as a medical
student at an American University required such
an amount of moral courage as we should never
have expected from a young and timid Hindu lady
who could know little of the world outside her
Zenânah, and had probably never spoken to a man
except her husband and members of her own family.
She was married already, when she conceived her
plan of going to America, and such was her strength
of character that she succeeded in persuading her
husband to accompany her in her voyage of discovery,
and to support her in her endeavour to
preserve her caste while living abroad. “I will go
to America as a Hindu,” she said, “and come back
and live among my people as a Hindu.” And she
carried out her resolve in spite of endless difficulties.
Yes, she had been married in 1874, at the age of
nine. We can hardly believe in such marriages, yet
they exist, and in her case this early, nay premature
marriage proved certainly most successful. No
wonder therefore that, when she was asked to speak
about child-marriages before an American audience,
she should have stood up for them, even in the
presence of her friend Râmabâi, treating them, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>course, as what they really are, betrothals, but
betrothals binding for life. Accompanied by her
husband, Gopalrao Vinayak Joshee, she arrived in
the United States, being really the first Brâhman
lady who had ever set foot in New York. From
thence she went to Philadelphia, where her arrival
is described to us by her friend, Dr. Rachel Bodley.
“One day in September, 1883,” she writes, “there
came to my door a little lady in a blue cotton
saree, accompanied by her faithful friend, Mrs.
B. F. Carpenter of New Jersey, and since that hour,
when, speechless for very wonder, I bestowed a kiss
of welcome upon the strangers cheek instead of
words, I have loved the women of India. The little
lady was Mrs. Ânandibâi Joshee, who had come to
study medicine in the Medical College of Pennsylvania.”
Dr. Bodley proved a true friend in need to
the lonely stranger. She tells us that “though from
the first Ânandibâi had received a cordial welcome
in America, it must have been with some heart-sinking
that she settled down alone in her college
rooms, confronted by the anthracite coal stove,
which was the only means of cooking her food, and
which she did not know how to manage. She tried
faithfully to prosecute her studies, and at the same
time keep caste-rules and cook her own food, but
the anthracite coal stove in her room was a constant
vexation and likewise a source of danger, and the
solitude of the individual house-keeping was overwhelming.
After a trial of two weeks her health
declined to such an alarming extent that I invited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>her to pay a short visit to my home, and she never
left it again to dwell elsewhere in Philadelphia during
her student-residence. In the performance of College
duties, going in and out, up and down, always in her
measured, quiet, dignified, patient way, she has filled
every room with memories which now hallow the
home and must continue to do so throughout the
years to come.” Ânandibâi’s faculties developed
rapidly under Western opportunities, her scientific
acquirements placed her high in rank among her
peers in College, and on March 11, 1886, she took
her medical degree, being the first Hindu woman
to receive the Degree of Doctor of Medicine in any
country. On June 1, 1886, she was appointed to
the position of Physician-in-Charge of the Female
Ward of the Albert Edward Hospital at Kolhapur,
and on October 9 she sailed from New York to
assume the duties of her new official position. But,
alas, the strain of the last three years in a foreign
land had undermined her constitution, perchance the
cold of the American winters had attacked lungs
inured to naught but tropical heat, and when she
landed in Bombay it was found that she was in an
advanced stage of consumption. She had come
home to die, and, after spending three years in the
study of medicine, she must have known very well
the fate that awaited her. After these three years
of voluntary exile, she found herself once more in
the familiar places of her childhood, at Poonah, surrounded
by her mother and sisters, and it was her
mother’s sad privilege to support her daughter in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>her arms when at midnight the end came quickly.
This occurred on February 26, 1887, in the home
in which she was born.</p>

<p class='c006'>All this is unspeakably sad. So much silent
heroism, so many sacrifices patiently borne for years,
and then at the end resignation, and farewell!
Mrs. Bodley, who has been such a motherly friend
both to Ânandibâi and Râmabâi, and to whom we
owe most of what we have been allowed to know
of Ânandibâi’s last years, when receiving the photograph
of her protégée taken on her deathbed, writes:
“The pathos of that lifeless form is indescribable.
The last of several pictures taken during the brief
public career of the little reformer, it is the most
eloquent of them all. The mute lips, and the face
wan and wasted and prematurely aged in the fierce
battle with sorrow and pain alike convey to her
American friends this message, not to be forgotten:
‘I have done what I could.’”</p>

<p class='c006'>If we consider all the impediments that barred
the way of a young Indian lady when conceiving
the plan of studying medicine in a foreign country,
we are amazed at Ânandibâi’s courage and perseverance,
and we shall hesitate before we declare
that Hindu women cannot be worthy peers of English
women. Our own lady doctors, who have cut their
way through the compact phalanx of prejudice and
jealousy, can best judge of the heroism of their
unknown Hindu colleague, whose name ought to
hold its place on the roll of those who have fallen
in a noble fight, and whose very death marks a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>victory. Though she had so painfully striven to
preserve her caste in a foreign land, it seemed
doubtful at first whether the Brâhmans of Poonah
would receive her as pure, after her long sojourn
among unbelievers. But humanity proved too strong
even for caste. Men and women, old and young,
orthodox and unorthodox, all received the young
doctor with open arms, paid her friendly visits, and
extended to her a most cordial welcome. Her own
friends were astonished at the unprecedented concession
made in her favour by the strictly orthodox
party. And when the end came the whole of Poonah
seemed to share in the mourning of the family, and
the fear that the priests might raise objections to
cremating her body according to the sacred rites
of the Hindus, proved perfectly groundless. Not
only on the occasion of her funeral, but earlier,
when her husband offered sacrifices to the gods and
the guardian planets to avert their anger and her
death, the priests showed no sign of any prejudice
against him or her. This, too, is a victory, for it
shows that even the most inveterate social and
religious diseases are not incurable when treated
with unselfish love and generosity. If all this could
be achieved by a frail young daughter of India,
what is there that could be called impossible for
the strong men of that country? Even now her
example has been followed, and Ânandibâi’s life has
not been in vain.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>National Character of the Hindus.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>No wonder that those who look upon the Indian
nation as an inferior race should have so often
protested against my judgment of them as prejudiced
and as far too favourable. I know quite well that
the men and women of whom I have here spoken
are exceptional beings. They would be exceptional
in England also, and anywhere else. But exceptions,
after all, represent possibilities, and the good work
achieved by such men as Rammohun Roy, Keshub
Chunder Sen, and Malabâri, or by Râmabâi, shows
how much of real power lies dormant in the people
of India. If it is always wise in judging of people to
look more to their strong than to their weak points;
why should we, in trying to determine the average
intellectual and moral stature of the Hindus, take
account of their dwarfs rather than of their giants?
Is it right, for instance, to say that all Indians are
liars? It is a very hackneyed charge, but it is
never forgotten, and it often crops up again when
least expected. Because culprits before an Indian
judge and witnesses before a jury, nay, even cooks
and butlers in Anglo-Indian homes, have occasionally,
or even frequently, told lies, does it follow that all
Indians are liars? It is unfortunate that so many
who have spent their lives as civil servants or
officers in India should represent the few hundreds
or the few thousands of people with whom they
have been brought into contact at Calcutta, Benares,
Bombay, or Madras as fair specimens of the people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>of India at large. It should never be forgotten that
the true home of the Indians is in their villages,
and that those who go to Calcutta or other great
towns to take service in English families are by no
means the best specimens of the Indian population.
They are willing to submit for some time to the
unkind treatment which they not seldom receive
from men, women, and children of alien origin; but
they can but seldom feel any real attachment or
even respect for their employers, though here, too,
there are most honourable exceptions. From the
earliest times truthfulness has always been mentioned
as a national characteristic of the inhabitants
of India, and we are now told that all Indians are
liars! We cannot open any of the ancient law-books
or epic poems without coming across such sentences
as “Truth is the ladder to heaven and the ship
across the ocean”; “The end of all the Vedas is
Truth”; “Seeking after all the virtues, I have
nowhere found anything so purifying as Truth.” We
appeal to the literatures of other nations as records
of their true character, why not in the case of the
Hindus? It is easy to say that all this is changed
now, and that those who have been magistrates and
judges in India ought to know best. But do these
judges consider the peculiar difficulties with which
the lower classes in India have to contend, being ruled
by men of a different colour, of a different language,
and a different religion? Would they expect or find
much regard for truth even in an English sailor if
examined by a French, ay, even by an English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>judge? It is easy to be truthful if you have nothing
to fear, but we must not wonder if, to escape an
oath or a kick, a native servant will now and then
tell a lie to his master. Anyhow, one case, a hundred,
nay, a thousand cases are not sufficient to
condemn a whole nation of more than two hundred
millions. It has been my rule through life never
to accept any of these sweeping assertions about a
whole nation. If I hear a man calling all Indians liars,
I generally ask how many he has known, and I do
the same when I hear all Frenchmen called monkeys,
all Italians assassins, all Germans unwashed, all
Russians savages, or even England <i>Perfide Albion</i>.
I have never in all my life repented having had
eyes for the bright side rather than the dark side
of nations as well as of individuals. I hoped I had
exposed the fallacy and folly of such undiscriminating
accusations in the Lectures which I gave at Cambridge,
to the candidates for the Indian Civil Service,
Lect. 2, “On the Truthful Character of the Hindus.”
But no, the old charge is brought up again and
again. That some members of the Indian Civil
Service who had for years to deal with native
servants and tradesmen should have had some
painful experiences, who can doubt? Even within
the small circle of my own personal acquaintances
I have met with Indians who disregarded the old
commandment of telling the truth; but to generalise
in such matters, from a limited number of instances,
is surely against all the rules of inductive logic.
This prejudice against the inhabitants of India as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>being a nation of liars may become really dangerous
in its consequences. Even now, as the press is open
to the ruled as well as to the rulers of India, the
charge of ingrained untruthfulness has been hurled
back most savagely by the accused on the accusers.
It always is so, and there is in the end but one remedy,
even when an inclination towards untruthfulness
does exist, and that is trust. I have no doubt that
I shall be much abused again for having ventured
to say so much, and to stand up for the people of
India, and particularly for having produced evidence
in support of my opinion, taken from their literature,
ancient and modern, from their sacred books, their
law-books, and their philosophical systems. Such
evidence is admitted when we judge of any other
nation; why should it be ruled out of court in the
case of the people of India?</p>

<p class='c006'>Missionaries seem to imagine that they have
a better chance of spreading their own religion by
vilifying the popular religion of India, and trying to
show that all the vices of the people are due to it.
King Asoka, in the third century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, knew better,
when he had his edicts engraved all over his kingdom,
and declared “that people should never praise their
own religion or disparage other religions without
a cause; and that whenever there is a cause, our
words should be moderate.” Our own missionaries
might safely take these words to heart. At all
events, no virtue stands higher in the eyes of the
founders of the Indian religion than truthfulness,
and if religion has any influence in forming the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>character of a whole nation, no nation should be
more truthful than that of India.</p>

<p class='c006'>I am far from being an indiscriminate admirer of
India, and, if I am told that I exaggerate the good
qualities of the people, I am quite willing to confess
that even among the small number of young men
who are now sent every year from India to England,
and particularly to Oxford, I have myself had some
disappointing experiences. Want of straightforwardness
arising from want of moral courage, want of
truthfulness arising from a desire to please, hollow
pretence amounting in some cases to actual deception,
all these I have witnessed among the young
men who now come to spend two or three years at
Oxford. But may we not look upon these defects
as clouds that will pass? And are there never any
cases of untruthfulness when there has been a disturbance
in college, or when an election has to be
carried, <i>coûte qu’il coûte</i>. The worst of it is that those
who complain of untruthfulness in others, cannot help
posing as patterns of truthfulness themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>I may mention some curious cases. A young
Bengali told me that he came all the way from
Benares to Oxford, because he had been told by his
friends who had contributed money towards the
founding of an Indian Institute there, that he would
be received there and enabled to attend lectures in
the University. How he had paid his passage
money I cannot understand, but I believe the poor
boy was actually starving when he came to me, and
he was in despair, when I had to tell him that there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>was no such institution at Oxford, and no scholarships
open to him as he had been led to imagine.
He told me that he had been to the Indian Institute,
but could get no help. He told me that he saw no
students or teachers there, but only stuffed animals.
“My friends in India,” he said, “have been asked
to subscribe money for the benefit of Indian students
at Oxford, but no one would even speak to me or
help me there. If one of your students,” he added,
“came to Benares, our Pandits would receive him
with open arms, teach him all they know, and gladly
give him food and lodging.” “Yes,” I said, “but
the laws of Manu do not apply to England.” I gave
him the little he wanted, but what became of him
afterwards I cannot tell, nor how he found the
means of returning to his own country. I confess
I was at first a little suspicious, but, after all, his
story may have been true, and what then?</p>

<p class='c006'>The manners of the young Indians when they
arrive at Oxford are generally excellent, but they
soon acquire what they consider English manners,
rough and ready, bluff and blunt, and by no means
an improvement on their own. The same young
man who at first enters your room with folded hands
and a graceful salâm, will after a very short time
walk in, sit down, stretch out his legs, and address
you in the most familiar terms. They imagine that
this is English. Some profess to know Sanskrit, and
pour out a stream of words which at school they may
have learnt by heart, but often with an utter disregard
of case and gender. Some who had failed, as we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>afterwards were informed by the authorities, to even
pass their matriculation examination in Sanskrit at
the Calcutta University, posed as Pandits at Oxford,
expressing at the same time their undisguised contempt
for all who professed to know and to teach
Sanskrit in the Universities of England. These men
have a very curious way of blushing. If you convict
them of a downright falsehood, their bright brown
colour turns suddenly greyish, but their eloquence
in defending themselves never fades or flags.</p>

<p class='c006'>Altogether the experiment of sending young
Hindus to prepare for the Civil Service Examination
in England has not, as far as I have been able to
judge, proved a great success. At Oxford they find
it very hard to make friends among the better class
of undergraduates. Most of our undergraduates
come from public schools, and have plenty of friends
of their own. If they are asked to be kind to any
of the Indian students, all they can do, or really be
expected to do, is to invite them once or twice to
a breakfast party. They have hardly any interests
in common with them, and anything like friendship
is out of the question. If the young students from
India have money to spend, there is danger of their
falling into bad company, and even if they pass
their examinations, I am afraid that some of them
return to India not much improved by their English
exile. The worst of it is that they often return
<i>désillusionné</i>. At first everything English is grand
and perfect in their eyes, an Oxford degree is the
highest goal of their ambition. But when they have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>obtained it, chiefly by learning by heart, they make
very light of it. And this making light of it is soon
applied to other things English also, which they
hear constantly criticised or abused, particularly in
the newspapers and in Parliament, so that they
often leave England better informed, it may be, but
hardly better affected towards the Government
which they are meant to serve. The present state
of things is certainly discouraging, particularly as it
seems impossible to suggest any real remedy. But
here also there are bright exceptions, and I have
always held that we must judge of things by their
bright rather than by their dark sides. There are,
and there always will be, difficulties in the intercourse
between Europeans and Orientals. It is
wonderful to see how well they have been overcome
in the Government of India. Natives in the Civil
Service or at the Bar seem to work quite harmoniously
with their English colleagues, and even after
they have reached high employment, and have to
exercise authority, little has been heard of conflicts,
whether caused by arrogance or subserviency. There
are Continental statesmen who, while they cannot
help admiring the English system of governing
India, look upon it as suicidal in the end. They
consider the Russian system of complete repression
as the only right system of dealing with Orientals,
and as far more merciful in the end. Well, we must
wait for the end; but, whatever it may be, it seems
right to treat the inhabitants of India as they have
been hitherto treated by the Government and by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>wisest rulers of India, not as born enemies or as
conspirators to be kept under by force, but as loyal
subjects to be trusted. Of course, there sometimes
will be troubles, for how can it be expected that in
two or three hundred millions of conquered subjects
there should be no grumbling, no disaffection, no
fanaticism? The government of India by a mere
handful of Englishmen is, indeed, an achievement
unparalleled in the whole history of the world. The
suppression of the Indian mutiny shows what stuff
English soldiers and statesmen are made of. If people
say that ours is not an age for Epic poetry, let them
read Lord Roberts’ “Forty-one Years in India.”
When I see in a circus a man standing with outstretched
legs on two or three horses, and two men
standing on his shoulders, and other men standing
on theirs, and a little child at the top of all, while the
horses are running full gallop round the arena, I feel
what I feel when watching the government of India.
One hardly dares to breathe, and one wishes one
could persuade one’s neighbours also to sit still and
hold their breath. If ever there were an accident,
the crash would be fearful, and who would suffer
most? Fortunately, by this time the people of
India know all this, and they have learnt to
appreciate what they owe not only to the <i>Pax</i>, but
to the <i>Lux Britannica</i>. If one could dare to read
the mind of three hundred millions, I should say
that in the present state of things the people of
India, as a whole, want no change except such
changes as can be achieved by ordinary constitutional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>means. It is true that I have not known a
large number of Indians, but I have known Indians
who could well speak in the name of large numbers,
and they speak to me more openly perhaps than to
others, looking upon me as a kind of Mle<i>kkh</i>a, but
at the same time as half an Indian. Some young
Indian Râjahs while travelling in Switzerland, found
themselves lately in the same railway carriage with
some Russian princes and noblemen. They had
been discussing among themselves some of their
grievances in English, and the Russians, who of
course understood English, after listening to them
for some time, became very communicative, and
began to explain to them the beneficent rule of the
Tsar. They even went so far as to hold out a hope
to them of an Indian Parliament, as soon as the
Russians were settled in Calcutta. On parting they
asked the Indian princes, “When shall we see you
at St. Petersburg?” And they were not a little
taken aback when the strangers bowed and smiled,
and said, “We are going just now to be present at
the opening of Parliament in London. We should
like very much to see St. Petersburg afterwards,
and to be present at the opening of your Parliament
there....”</p>

<p class='c006'>Again and again have I been urged to go to
India, and have been told many a time by people
who had spent a few months there that I could
never hope to know the Indians, to understand
Indian literature, or even pronounce Sanskrit properly
without having passed a vacation at Calcutta or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Bombay. I would have given anything to go to
India when I was young. There was a time when
I was on the point of becoming a missionary in
order to be able to spend some years in India. But
what a strange missionary I should have made!
What I cared to know in India were not the Râjahs
and Mahârâjahs, the streets of Bombay, the towers
of silence, or the temples of Ellora. What I cared
to see were the few remaining <i>S</i>rotriyas who still
knew their Vedas by heart, who would have talked
to me and shaken hands with me, even though
I was a Mle<i>kkh</i>a. Had they not asked me even at
a distance to act as one of the sixteen priests at
their Shrâddhs (<i>S</i>râddhas), their funeral services?
Had they not asked me to recite Vedic prayers for
the souls of their deceased fathers? Had they not
actually sent me the same presents which on those
occasions they are bound to give to their priests,
because, as they wrote, I knew the Veda better than
their own priests? Had they not actually sent me
the sacred Brâhmanic thread which I am as proud
to wear as any more brilliant decoration?</p>

<p class='c006'>Here is a letter which I received some years ago
beautifully printed in gold:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“<span class='sc'>Respected Sir</span>,—On the occasion of my departed
fathers Shrâddh ceremony, which was celebrated
some months ago, amongst the offerings to Adhyâpaks
and Âchâryas (teachers), an offering was made
to you in consideration of your eminent services to
the laws of Sanskrit literature (<i>sic</i>). I am a believer
in the New Dispensation of the Brahmo-Somâj of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>India, which teaches reverence to the great and
good men of all lands and religions. I trust you
will kindly accept the piece of shawl sent in separate
parcels, and pronounce your blessing both for me
and for the spirit of my honoured father in heaven.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Was it very wrong or sacrilegious that I did so?
I extract a few sentences from the letter I wrote in
reply:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“I deeply sympathise with your Shrâddh ceremony;
nay, I wish we had something like it in our own
religion. To keep alive the memory of our parents,
to feel their presence during the great trials of our
life, to be influenced by what we know they would
have wished us to do, and to try to honour their
name by showing ourselves not unworthy bearers of
it, that is a Shrâddh ceremony in which we can all
partake, nay, ought to partake, whatever our religion
may be. There is a real, though unseen bond of
union (tantu) that connects us through our parents
and ancestors with the Great Author of all things,
and the same bond will connect ourselves through
our children with the most distant generations. If
we know that, and are constantly reminded of it by
ceremonies like that of your Shrâddh, we are not
likely to forget the responsibility that rests on every
one of us. In that sense your Shrâddh is a blessing,
on your parents because on yourselves, and whatever
the future of your religion may be in India,
I hope this communion with the spirits of your
ancestors, or Pit<i>ri</i>s, will always form an essential
part of it.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>Two or three years in India would certainly have
been a delight to me, but short of that I did not
care to go. I was quite satisfied with that ideal
India which I had built up for myself, whether from
their books or from those who had come to see me
at Oxford. If my India, as I am often told, is an
ideal India, is it more so than Greece as seen
through the poems of Homer, or Italy as seen
through the verses of Virgil? What is ideal is not
necessarily unreal, it is only like a landscape seen
in sunshine. Look at a landscape on a brilliant
summer’s day bathed in light and verdure, and
again on a bleak day of March with its bitter winds
and cloudy sky. It is the same landscape, but which
of the two is its true aspect? I shall not speak
here of ancient Indian poets, of ancient Indian
philosophers, or of ancient Indian heroes. What
I feel, and what I wish my friends would feel with
me, is that a country which, even in these unheroic
days, could produce a Rammohun Roy, a Keshub
Chunder Sen, a Malabâri, and a Râmabâi, is not
a decadent country, but may look forward to a
bright, sunny future, as it can look back with satisfaction
and even pride on four thousand years of
a not inglorious history.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have never bestowed excessive praise on Indian
literature, nor do I feel answerable for having filled
the brains of native scholars with exaggerated ideas
about its value. Its value to us is great, but chiefly
from a historical point of view, and this is just what
native scholars find it so difficult to understand.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>No wonder that after Goethe had bestowed such
superlative praise on the Sanskrit play of “<i>S</i>akuntalâ,”
the Hindus should have spoken of their Kâlidâsa
as the equal of Shakespeare. They forget that
what surprised Goethe was not only the beauty of
Kâlidâsa’s poetry, great as it is, but its antiquity,
and the fact that such refined poetry should have
existed where it was least expected, and at a time
when it could not have been matched by the poetry
of any other country.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>Indian Theosophy.</h3>

<p class='c012'>Empty panegyrics are always to be deprecated,
and I am afraid that great and lasting mischief has
been wrought, for instance, by Madame Blavatsky
and her friends who went to India, ignorant of
Sanskrit and Sanskrit literature, and who have for
years been proclaiming to the world at large that
Hindu philosophy, particularly that of the Vedânta
and that of Buddhism, which they did not always
distinguish very carefully one from the other, was
infinitely superior to all the philosophies of Europe,
that the Brâhmans even at the present day were
the depositaries of the primeval wisdom of the
world, and that by the united efforts of Madame
Blavatsky and Dayânanda Sarasvatî a new theosophy
would dawn on India and Europe which would
eclipse all former systems of thought. Poor Dayânanda
Sarasvatî had no idea of what Madame
Blavatsky was thinking of; but, though bewildered
for a time by the unaccustomed adulation poured on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>him and the extravagant veneration paid to him by
Europeans, he soon recovered, and declined to have
anything to do with the Polish prophetess and her
vagaries.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mme. Blavatsky might certainly have done a good
work if she had joined some really learned Pandits,
familiar with the six systems of Hindu philosophy;
nor would it have been too much for a person
endowed with such extraordinary, if not miraculous,
powers as she was said to have possessed, to have
mastered the grammar of Sanskrit. But what has
been the result of all her labours? Indian philosophy
has gained some Corybantic followers, but
the true teaching of Bâdarâya<i>n</i>a and Kapila has
been obscured rather than illuminated by being
mixed up with poor and contemptible conjuring
tricks. New prejudices have been roused against
the noble philosophies of Vedânta, Sâ<i>m</i>khya, and
Yoga which it will take many years to remove.
Why not take the authoritative texts of these
systems, many of which have been translated into
English and German, and place their essential
doctrines in a clear and intelligible form before
the philosophic public of Europe? There is no
mystery about that philosophy, or about the Mahâtmans
who are versed in it. There is nothing esoteric
in their teaching; all is open to those who are
properly qualified and trustworthy. Their Upanishads
and Dar<i>s</i>anas can be studied exactly like the
philosophies of Plato or DesCartes—nay, even better,
because every one of their tenets has been put down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>in their Sûtras very clearly and definitely by Indian
philosophers far more so than by Plato or Hegel.
It is difficult, therefore, not to get angry if one sees
the elevated views of these ancient philosophers
dragged down to the level of cloudy hallucinations,
and rendered absurd by being mixed up with vulgar
trickeries. “<span lang="la">Corruptio optimi pessima.</span>”</p>

<p class='c006'>I have often been blamed for the hard judgments
which I have pronounced against Madame Blavatsky
and her friends. I have been told that she and her
friends have done good by rousing a new interest in
their ancient philosophy among the people of India,
and by attracting the attention of European thinkers
towards it. If that is so, let it be to their credit; but
I feel convinced that no good has ever come from
anything that is not perfectly honest and straightforward;
and what a lurid light has been thrown on
the Theosophist Society at Adyar! There is no
excuse for such things, however good the intention
may have been, and even now, when I see well-intentioned
men like Vivekânanda preaching the
doctrines of the Upanishads, of Bâdarâya<i>n</i>a and
Sa<i>m</i>kara in America, and gaining, as I read, numerous
converts, I still seem to perceive now and then
something of the old Blavatsky leaven, that has not
yet been entirely thrown off. Vedântism requires
no bush, no trappings, no tricks. What we want is
a historical and critical treatment, just the same as
that which has been applied to Plato and Aristotle.</p>

<p class='c006'>When I saw hundreds of people running after
Madame Blavatsky and her apostles, and the texts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>and the excellent translations of the philosophical
Sûtras hardly looked at, an old Oriental story often
came into my mind. The story is a mere illustration,
a D<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>ânta, but it is full of truth.</p>

<p class='c006'>“A certain man had the peculiar power of grunting
exactly like a pig, so much so that whenever
he grunted where pigs were grazing they would all
turn round to see if any new member had come into
their fold. This man’s fame spread abroad, and he
began a tour to obtain money by means of his art.
Wherever he went he erected a pandal, and issued
tickets for admission, all of which got exhausted
very soon, such was the eagerness of people to hear
him grunt. While he was thus making money in
a village a sage happened to pass by with his
disciples, and it struck him that he could teach
a good lesson to them through this incident.
Accordingly he ordered a small pandal to be
erected, and advertised that even better grunting
would be heard here than in the other pandal, and
that free of cost. The people were naturally very
eager to hear it, and they visited it. The sage
brought a real pig before them, and squeezing it
a little, made it grunt. Really the grunt was much
better than the man’s, but the people exclaimed,
‘Pooh, is this all? We hear this every day, but
what is there in it? It is nothing wonderful,’ and
went away. The sage said, ‘Here is a splendid
lesson for us. We seldom care for reality, but
always go in for imitation.’ That is why even this
world exists, which is a mere imitation, a reflection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>in the distorting mirror of Mâyâ, of the great Âtman.
No external help is required to see the Self,
but very few care for it, and, even if you eagerly
advertise it, none will go to you except those who
love truth for truth’s sake. Reflect on this.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This story is a mere parable, and, as such, cannot
possibly offend anybody. At all events, if anybody
might complain, it would be the showman of the
real pig, not the mere imitator. I have never seen
Madame Blavatsky. She threatened once she would
come to Oxford to face and to confound me, but she
never did. Though she preached to the undergraduates
at Balliol, she never came near me. It
is simply my love of genuine Indian philosophy that
induced me to protest against what I knew to be
a mere travesty of Vedânta, Sâ<i>m</i>khya, and Yoga
philosophy. If even in this travestied form Indian
philosophy has found friends, in India and Europe,
owing to her preaching, I am quite content, but
Satyam paramo dharma<i>h</i>, “Truth is the highest
religion,” or the highest virtue, and nothing, I am
deeply convinced, can prosper for any length of
time that is mixed up with exaggeration or untruth.
If it is right and our bounden duty to protest
against foolish disfigurements of our own religion,
why should misrepresentation of the Hindu religion
and Hindu philosophy be allowed to pass unchallenged?</p>

<p class='c006'>From what I have seen and read of Vivekânanda
and his colleagues, they seem to me honestly bent
on doing good work, and I feel the same about the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>propaganda carried on by Dharmapâla in favour of
Buddhism. It is honest, it is unselfish, it is free
from juggling. Vivekânanda and the other followers
of Râmak<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a ought, however, to teach their
followers how to distinguish between the perfervid
utterances of their teacher, Râmak<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a, an enthusiastic
Bhakta (devotee), and the clear and dry style
of the Sûtras of Bâdarâya<i>n</i>a. The Vedânta spirit
is there, but the form often becomes too vague
and exaggerated to give us an idea of what the
true <i>Gñ</i>ânin (knower) ought to be. However, as
long as these devoted preachers keep true to the
Upanishads, the Sûtras, and the recognised commentaries,
whether of Sa<i>m</i>kara or of Râmânu<i>g</i>a,
I wish them all the success which they deserve by
their unselfish devotion and their high ideals.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>My Indian Correspondents.</h3>

<p class='c012'>Were I to publish any of the innumerable letters
which I receive from unknown correspondents from
every part of India, some written in English, others
in Sanskrit, they would surprise many readers by
showing how like the present political, philosophic,
and religious atmosphere in the higher classes of
Indian society is to our own. My Indian friends are
interested in the same questions which interest us,
and they often refer us to their own ancient philosophers
who have discussed the same questions many
centuries ago. Many of them read and write English
perfectly well, though there is a certain bluntness in
their questions which would startle us in England.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>While I am writing these lines, a letter signed
by a number of Indian gentlemen is lying on my
table, as yet unanswered, and, if the nature of the
questions be considered, likely to remain unanswered
for some time. To us some of these questions
sound certainly very startling, but they are nevertheless
interesting, because they show us the problems
on which the Indian mind is brooding, and
which to many of them are like their daily bread.
We ourselves are more inclined to suppress questions
of this kind, or to say with Sir Philip Sidney,
“Reason cannot show itself more reasonable than
to leave off reasoning on things above reason.” To
Indian thinkers, however, there seem to be no regions
at all which cannot be approached and penetrated by
human reason.</p>

<p class='c006'>The questions on which my unknown friends
want my answer, and probably expect it by return
of post, are:—</p>

<p class='c006'>(1) What is your opinion regarding God and
soul? Is the latter a reflection of the former, or
is the one quite separate from the other?</p>

<p class='c006'>Athanasius might have answered such a question,
but how can I?</p>

<p class='c006'>(2) If both God and soul are said to have been
separated from the beginning, then how, when, and
whence is the latter afflicted with Karman (acts and
their results) which cause sad suffering to each
individual soul?</p>

<p class='c006'>(3) Is the universe eternal and self-abiding, or
has it been created by some one?</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>(4<span class='fss'>A</span>) Taking it for granted that there is some one
to be considered the Creator of the universe, we
want to know what was the period of the creation,
and how long the creation will last; what it was
at first, and what will it be hereafter? Did the
Creator create all beings (old and young, children
and parents) in a moment, or did He create them in
succession? Were male and female created at the
same time, or one after the other?</p>

<p class='c006'>(4<span class='fss'>B</span>) Did the Creator bestow rewards on the
actions of men in a former life, or did He create
them freely of His own accord? Is He the Giver
of rewards, the Ruler of the Universe, or simply the
Creator?</p>

<p class='c006'>(4<span class='fss'>C</span>) How is it, then, that God created rich and
poor, happy and sad? What were the acts that
could have produced such results?</p>

<p class='c006'>(5) What is the real matter of the five elements—earth,
water, fire, air, and ether, and of the soul?
What is the origin of the smallest atoms (paramâ<i>n</i>u)
and of time?</p>

<p class='c006'>(6) Is there any method which, acted upon, will
save us from anxieties and troubles of this world,
and by means of which we may reach Nirvâ<i>n</i>a?</p>

<p class='c006'>(7) What was the origin of idol-worship? Is it
good, or is it contrary to the Sacred Books?</p>

<p class='c006'>(8) Was Buddhism an offshoot of <i>G</i>ainism, or vice
versa? or have both religions arisen separately from
time immemorial?</p>

<p class='c006'>(9) By whom were the Vedas compiled, and what
do they treat of?</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>(10) Where does the soul go to after death? Is
there any heaven or hell in which the rewards of
actions, both good and bad, are to be enjoyed?</p>

<p class='c006'>My correspondents, who are evidently men of
cultivated minds, describe themselves simply as
cloth-merchants. I know nothing more about them,
but we may learn from their letter what is the
unseen stream of thought running through India.
They seem to belong to the Digambara sect of the
<i>G</i>ain religion. I doubt whether any English cloth-merchants
would have appealed to J. S. Mill or to
Darwin for a solution of such metaphysical difficulties.
We may consider such questions unreasonable,
only we must not imagine that because we do
not speak of these riddles, we ourselves have solved
them. Nay, it may be useful to be reminded from
time to time of the limits of our knowledge, so as
not to trust too much to the omniscience of our own
philosophers.</p>

<p class='c006'>I often feel ashamed that I cannot answer such
letters. But first of all, let me assure my kind
correspondents that I am not omniscient, and never
pretended to be so. On some of the questions they
ask me, their own philosophers have said all that
can be said, more even than our own. But let them
consider likewise that with the best will on my part,
I should have no time left for my own studies,
were I to attempt to enter on a discussion of such
problems as are set before me by my unknown
friends in India and elsewhere. Every one who
writes to me seems to imagine that he is the only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>person who does so. If they saw the chaos of unanswered
letters on my table they would see that
I do not exaggerate, and would understand that it
would be physically impossible for any human being
to answer all the letters addressed to me. Life has
its limits, every day has its limits, and one hour out
of the twenty-four might well be left to an old man
for dreaming, for looking back on the years and
the friends that are gone, and forward to that life
to which our stay on earth forms, as he thinks, but
a short prelude.</p>

<p class='c006'>In one respect, as I pointed out before, the Indians
differ from us very characteristically. They give
very free expression to their sentiments, whether of
love or of admiration, and even when they have to
express their disapproval they do it in the gentlest
and least offensive words. Some of them have expressed
to me on several occasions their surprise,
nay, disgust, at the rudeness and coarseness of
certain Sanskrit scholars in their literary controversies.
Some people may call Oriental gentleness
and courtesy flattery, some dishonesty, and it certainly
would be so for us. Even in French and
Italian, however, there are some expressions which
we would not use in English, and which, if translated
into English, sound to us unreal and exaggerated,
while not to use them would amount in French to
a want of politeness. We are not so easily <i>enchanted</i>
or <i>ravished</i>, nor are we always <i>devoted servants</i>, but
at the same time I must confess that our <i>yours truly</i>
sounds almost brutal in answer to the eloquent finish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>of the letters of our French friends. But though
I fully admit that considerable deductions must be
made from the panegyrics addressed to us by our
Indian correspondents, it would be wrong to accuse
them of intentional insincerity. If their panegyrics
seem sometimes to come very near to an apotheosis,
we must not forget that their Devas or gods are not
looked upon as anything very extraordinary after all.</p>

<p class='c006'>I must mention at least one instance when I was
agreeably surprised by the thorough sincerity of one
of my Indian correspondents, who certainly meant
far more than he said. The Mahârâjah of Vizianagram
wrote to me some years ago expressing a wish
to possess a copy of my edition of the “Rig-Veda”
in six volumes. It had been published at £15, but
when I applied to a second-hand bookseller he
charged £24, and told me that complete copies of
the book were getting very scarce. Soon after the
Mahârâjah wrote again asking the bookseller to
send him a second copy, but he was informed by his
agent in England that he could not get a complete
set for love or for money. The Mahârâjah wrote to
ask me why I did not bring out a new edition, and
I had to tell him what the expense of printing such
a work would be, and that, though I should gladly
give my labour for nothing, I could not find a
publisher in England, not even a University Press,
to undertake such a work. The Indian Government
had for years used the first edition for making
presents in Europe and in India, and though in this
way it had fully reimbursed itself for the original
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>outlay, it was not inclined to venture on a second
edition. Upon this the Mahârâjah, who had hitherto
been most lavish in his praises of the work, showed
that the praise he had bestowed on it was not mere
empty praise, but was really meant. After telling
me what his Pandits had said to him, and sending
me some valuable MSS., as a present, which they
had prepared for me, he offered to pay himself for
the printing of a new edition, if I would undertake
the labour of revising the text.</p>

<p class='c006'>This I readily accepted, and in two years, 1890
to 1892, a new, and I hope more correct edition,
was issued from the Press at Oxford in four large
volumes. The Mahârâjah paid to the Press not
less than £4,000. I found out afterwards that this
Indian nobleman was by no means a student, an
antiquarian, or a theologian; but, on the contrary,
a man of the world, very fond of racing and hunting.
He distinguished himself on one occasion, as I was
told, by riding up the staircase to the very roof of his
palace. When in one of my last letters I asked him
what had induced him to spend so large a sum on
the Rig-Veda, he replied that India wanted its Bible,
and he added, “It may benefit me hereafter.” That
hereafter has come sooner than he expected. He
died a comparatively young man, and as long as the
Veda lives his name will certainly not be forgotten.
The Veda has lived now for four thousand years,
or, according to Indian ideas, it has existed from all
eternity. Four thousand years is but a small slice
of eternity, but are there many books that have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>lasted or will last four thousand years? I ought to
add that his liberality did not stop at paying the
expenses of the work, but that he placed a large
number of copies at my disposal, which was more
than I expected or deserved. Are there many
Mahârâjahs or Zemindârs in Europe who would
have spent so large a sum on a new edition of the
Bible, or, in fact, of any other important book?
Would any scholar even think of appealing to the
millionaires of England or America to help him in
bringing out an old forgotten book, if it “benefited
them hereafter” only? Anyhow, I came to learn
that Hindus are not simply grandiloquent, but that
they can do grand things also, when the opportunity
offers.</p>

<p class='c006'>If I finish here the list of my Indian friends, it is
not because I have no more names to add. We have
lately had a book called “Representative Indians,”
by C. P. Pillai, 1897, containing biographical sketches
of thirty-six distinguished Hindus and Parsis. Many
of them I have known or corresponded with, but of
their sentiments, their hopes and disappointments,
I know but little. The undercurrent of their life,
the deeper motives of their actions, are under a kind
of purdah, and we hardly ever get either autobiographical
confessions or outspoken memoirs. This
is a pity, and naturally deprives reminiscences of
Indian friends of much of that human interest which
everybody feels when catching glimpses of the more
intimate life of distinguished persons. We seldom
hear of a good or smart saying from a Hindu, such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>as we have in large numbers from English, German,
or French statesmen or poets. The people of India
are still a deep secret to us, and if I have succeeded
in withdrawing the curtain from only a small portion
of their inmost thoughts and feelings, if, here and
there, I have helped to change mere curiosity about
them into a warm human sympathy with them, my
reminiscences will have fulfilled their true object.
In some respects, and particularly in respect to the
greatest things (<span lang="grc">τὰ μέγιστα</span>), India has as much to
teach us as Greece and Rome, nay, I should say
more. We must not forget, of course, that we are
the direct intellectual heirs of the Greeks, and that
our philosophical currency is taken from the capital
left to us by them. Our palates are accustomed to
the food which they have supplied to us from our
very childhood, and hence whatever comes to us now
from the thought-mines of India is generally put aside
as merely curious or strange, whether in language,
mythology, religion, or philosophy. But however
foreign Indian thought may appear to us, it has
filled an important place in the growth of the human
race, and that growth is important, whether it took
place on the borders of the Ilissos or on the shores
of the Ganges. In India we still see, as it were, the
last traces of the primordial surprise at this world.
Their earliest thinkers seem still to feel strange
in it, while Greeks and Romans are thoroughly at
home in their little world. No doubt the Greeks
as well as the Indians saw the riddles of the world,
were perplexed by them, and tried to solve them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>But while Greeks and Romans, and later on the
leading races of Europe also, settled down to their
practical work in life, the Indians, at least the leading
thinkers among them, never felt quite at ease even
in their beautiful forests, by the side of their mighty
rivers, or under the shadow of their gigantic snow-mountains
in the north. They never cared so
intensely for this span of life on earth as the Greeks
did. Hence they never brought political life to its
full development, like the Greeks and Romans; they
never strove to conquer what was not theirs, or to
govern the world which they had conquered; nor
did they, like the Hebrews, look upon the exact
fulfilment of the law as the highest object of their life
on earth. Even while passing through this world,
their eyes were for ever fixed on the Beyond. They
strove to pierce through the dark roof of their
forests, to travel to the distant sources of their rivers,
and to transcend even the snowy peaks of the
Himâlaya Mountains. Their hearts would never
forget the life that lay behind them, and their minds
were for ever set on the life that was to come.</p>

<p class='c006'>The old questions of Whence? Why? and Whither?
fascinated and enthralled their thoughts. They may
have but little of practical wisdom to teach us, for
they paid but small attention to the arts of peace
and war. But, though they fell in consequence an
easy prey to their neighbours, they had something
nevertheless which their barbarous conquerors had
not. They had their own view of the world, and
this view, different as it is from our own, deserves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>to be looked at carefully and seriously by us.
Whatever we may think of the world which they
had built up for themselves, and in which they lived,
their idea of the Godhead is certainly higher, purer,
and more consistent than that of Greeks, Romans,
and Hebrews. They passed through polytheism,
henotheism, and monotheism, and they arrived at
last at what is generally called pantheism, but a
pantheism very different from vulgar pantheism.
They started with the firm conviction that what we
mean by God must be a Being without a second,
without beginning or end, without limitations of any
kind. Whatever there is or seems to be, call it
mind or matter, man or nature, can have one substance
only, one and the same, whatever we name it,
God, or Brahman, the Absolute, or the Supreme
Being. They never say, like other pantheists, that
everything in this phenomenal world is God, but
that everything has its being in God.</p>

<p class='c006'>How the change from the real to the phenomenal
came about, or, as we say, how the world was created,
they can tell us as little as we can tell them. They
simply point to the fact that it has come about, that
it is there, that it is and can be nothing but phenomenal
to us, but that the phenomenal could not
even seem to be without the real behind it. In
order to restore the phenomenal world to its reality,
they hold that all that is wanted is knowledge or
philosophy, which destroys that universal Nescience
which makes us all take the phenomenal for the
real, the objective for the subjective. Their philosophy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>is chiefly the Vedânta, though other systems
also pursue the same object. Each man is in substance
or in self identical with God, for what else
could he be? If they say that each man is God,
that would, no doubt, offend us, but that man and
everything else has its true being in the Godhead
is a very different kind of pantheism. To regain
that full self-consciousness or God-consciousness, to
return to God, to break down the artificial wall that
seemed to separate man from God, is the highest
object of Indian philosophy, and in some form or
other these thoughts have gradually leavened all
classes of society from the highest to the lowest.</p>

<p class='c006'>In order to be able to appreciate the true value
of the Vedânta, we have to study its growth in the
Upanishads, and in the minute disquisitions of the
Vedânta-Sûtras and their commentaries. No doubt
these are sometimes very tedious, and to us, in this
age of the world, may often appear childish and
useless. And yet the Vedânta view of the world
has a right to claim the same attention as that of
Heraclitus, Plato, Spinoza, or Kant. It is as true and
as untrue as any of these philosophical intuitions,
but it possesses an attraction of its own which has
held the best minds of India captive for generations,
and will continue to do so for ages to come.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nay, as we have always had among us Platonists,
Spinozists, and Kantians, the time will come, nay,
has come already, when European philosophers will
try to look at the world through the glasses of the
Vedânta also. It is well known that Schopenhauer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>no mean thinker of modern times, declared the
Vedânta as taught in the Upanishads “the product
of the highest wisdom” (<i>Ausgeburt der höchsten
Weisheit</i>). May not these words make other philosophers
pause before they reject as childish a
philosophy which Schopenhauer placed above the
philosophy of Giordano Bruno, Malebranche, and
Spinoza?</p>

<p class='c006'>India should be known, not from without, but
from within, and it will require a long time and
far abler hands than mine before we really know
what India was meant to be in the development of
mankind. Heinrich Simon remarked very truly,
“Our history is miserable because we have no
biographies.... If a man’s life lies open before me
from day to day in all his acts and all his thoughts,
so far as they can be represented externally, I gain
a better insight into the history of the time than
by the best general representation of it.” What we
want to know is, how the prominent men of India
imbibed the Vedânta, and how the principles they
had imbibed from that source influenced their lives,
their acts, and their thoughts. With us philosophy
remains always something collateral only. Our
mainstay is formed by religion and ethics. But with
the Hindus, philosophy is life in full earnest, it is
but another name for religion, while morality has
a place assigned to it as an essential preliminary
to all philosophy. Most of our greatest philosophers
and of their followers seem to lead two lives, one
as it ought to be, the other as it is. One of our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>greatest philosophers, Berkeley, knew quite well
what the world is, but he lived as a bishop, unconcerned
about the unreal character of all with which
he had to deal. There have been cases of true
Vedântists, also, who have led useful, active lives
as ministers and organisers of states, but he who
has grasped the highest truths of the Vedânta, or
has been grasped by them, is driven at once into
the solitude of the forests, waiting there for the
solution of all riddles, for perfect freedom, and in
the end for the truest freedom of all, for death—<span lang="grc">Θανοῦμαι
καὶ ἐλευθερήσομαι</span>.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>MY INDIAN FRIENDS.<br> <br> IV.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c011'>The Veda.</h3>

<p class='c012'>We live no longer in times when the head of
a great publishing firm would ask a scholar who
offered a translation of the Veda, as I know the
late Professor H. H. Wilson was asked, “But what
in all the world is the Veda, or what you call the
Rig-Veda?” But nevertheless in spite of the years
that have passed since, I am still asked from time
to time much the same question, and I confess
I cannot answer it in two words.</p>

<p class='c006'>I should not be surprised if even some of those
who are doing me the honour of reading my
Recollections of Auld Lang Syne, and who in this
volume of recollections of my Indian Friends, have
so often come across the name of Veda, were to
say in their secret heart, What in all the world can
that Veda be to which this misguided man has
devoted the whole of his life? I have been asked
such a question before now, and it is perhaps not
unreasonable that I should try to answer it here. For
after all, was not the Veda the first of my Indian
friends? Was it not the bridge that led me from
West to East, from Greece and Italy to India, nay,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>from Dessau to Oxford, from Germany to England?
Whatever other people may say about the misguided
man who sacrificed everything to the Veda,
I still count the Veda among my best friends, and
I sometimes regret that my duties as Professor of
Comparative Philology in the University of Oxford
should during my later years have withdrawn my
full allegiance from it. What then is the Veda?</p>

<p class='c006'>The Vedas, as we possess them, are four systematically
arranged collections of hymns and verses,
and the Veda is often used in the sense of these
four Vedas taken together. The first and most
important Veda is the Rig-Veda, which has often,
and not without some truth, been called the only
true Veda. It contains 1,017, or with some additions,
the Vâlakhilya-hymns, 1,028 hymns, each on an average
containing about ten verses. They are all
addressed to Devatâs or deities, and whatever subject
is addressed in these hymns, down to bows,
arrows, and stones, is supposed to become, <i>ipso facto</i>,
a Devatâ, while the poet is called the seer or Rishi.
The metres are numerous and strictly regulated,
though there is more freedom in them than in the
later artificial poetry of India.</p>

<p class='c006'>The hymns of the Rig-Veda were meant to be
recited at sacrifices, and this is no doubt the explanation
of their careful preservation during many
centuries, by means of a strictly regulated oral
tradition.</p>

<p class='c006'>The second, the Sâma-Veda, is a much smaller
collection of hymns, most of them borrowed from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>the Rig-Veda, but different in character so far as
they were meant to be sung at the ancient sacrifices.</p>

<p class='c006'>The third, the Ya<i>g</i>ur-Veda, consists of sacrificial
formulas and of verses to be repeated in a low voice
by a class of priests who were entrusted chiefly with
the manual work required for the performance of
sacrifices.</p>

<p class='c006'>The fourth, the Atharva-Veda, probably collected
at a later time, contains, besides many hymns from
the Rig-Veda, a large number of popular verses
used for magical and medicinal purposes, some of
them possibly of great antiquity, particularly if we
adopt the principle that whatever is very silly is
necessarily very old.</p>

<p class='c006'>Taken as a whole these hymns, particularly those
of the Rig-Veda, are certainly older than any other
poetry we possess in India, nay, older than any
literary composition we possess of any of the Aryan
nations in Asia or Europe. Their real interest,
however, consists not only in their age, but in the
simplicity and naturalness of their poetical addresses
to the most striking phenomena of nature by which
the Aryan settlers found themselves surrounded in
India, and in which and behind which they recognised
unseen agents by whom both their physical
and their moral life were powerfully influenced.</p>

<p class='c006'>If all books have their fates, the oldest book of
the world, the Veda, has certainly had the most
extraordinary fate. It was known to exist and
people began to write about it, long before it had
been seen or handled by any European. I remember
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>Baron Bunsen telling me how his chief object
in arranging to go to India with his pupil, Mr. Astor,
was to see whether there really was such a book in
existence. By consulting the <i>Lettres édifiantes</i> he
might have known that it was in existence as a real
book, and had been seen and handled by some of
the Catholic missionaries in India. But though
seen, not a line of it had ever been published, still
less translated, because native scholars, willing as
they might be to help missionaries and others in
reading the Laws of Manu, the Mahâbhârata and
Râmâya<i>n</i>a, were most decidedly unwilling to help
them to an understanding of the Veda. There
were, no doubt, many reasons for it, one of them
being possibly that there were few, if any, Brâhmans
at the beginning of this century who were able to
translate the Veda themselves. There were many
who knew it or large portions of it by heart, and
could recite the hymns at sacrifices and public or
private gatherings, but they did not even profess
that they understood it. They were proud to know
it by heart and by sound, and there were some who
actually thought that the hymns would lose their
magic power, if recited by one who understood their
meaning. Manuscripts were never very numerous,
and even when one of them fell into the hands of
Europeans, they soon found that, without a commentary,
the hymns baffled all endeavours at translation.</p>

<p class='c006'>During all that time the most exaggerated ideas
were spread about the Vedas. The Brâhmans
themselves declared that they contained the oldest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>divine revelation, that they were not the compositions
of human authors, but the work of Brahman,
the Supreme Spirit, who had revealed them to
inspired sages or Rishis, seers. European scholars
were carried away for a time by the hope that they
would find in these Vedas, if not the jabberings of
the Pithecanthropoi, at least the earliest flashes of
thoughts of an awakening humanity, the faint echoes
of a primordial wisdom going back to the very beginning
of human life on earth, “when the morning stars
sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>When at last not only the texts but the immense
Sanskrit commentary also of the most important,
the Rig-Veda, had been published, people began to
see that there was little of primeval, mysterious
wisdom to be found in the Vedic hymns, but
only the simplest thoughts that must have passed
through the minds of the Rishis when they began
to ponder on the great phenomena of nature which
every morning and night, every spring and winter
were unfolded before their eyes. No superhuman
revelation was required for that kind of poetry.
Nothing could be clearer than that the constant
themes of these Vedic songs were sunrise and
morning, day and night, earth and the rivers, storms,
lightning, rain, sunset and night. Even this was for
a time stoutly denied by writers who did not know
the Sanskrit alphabet. But what else was there to
interest the ancient Âryas? It is true that even the
Brâhmans themselves protested against the Western
scholars, whose translations seemed to reduce their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>sacred hymns to the low level of mere descriptions
of nature<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c017'><sup>[11]</sup></a>. We are not and never have been, they
said, mere sun-worshippers or fire-worshippers, or
rain-worshippers, but sun, fire, and sky were only
symbols to us of the Godhead, of one and the same
Divine Being in His manifold manifestations. In
one sense they were certainly right, but I doubt
whether many of the much abused Western
scholars had ever denied this. Many things have
to be taken as understood, and Western scholars
evidently took it for granted that when the Vedic
poets addressed their hymns to the dawn, to the
sun, the sky, the storm-winds, the earth, or the rain,
they did not simply mean the fiery ball that rose in
the morning and vanished at night, or the blue sky,
or the soil on which they stood, or the rain that had
fertilised the soil. The very fact that they addressed
these phenomena of nature with the pronoun of the
second person, changed them at once into persons, or
what were called Devatâs, deities, and thus the saying
of one of their old grammarians, Yâska, is justified,
that whatever object is addressed in these Vedic
hymns is to be called its Devatâ—or deity. Later on
it came to be recognised that there was even a deeper
ground for this deification, and that the necessities
of language, that is, of thought, did not allow at first
of any names being formed, except names of agent.
Dyaus, masc., for instance, the lighter, was earlier
than Dyaus, fem., what is lighted up, the sky.</p>

<p class='c006'>If we take some of the most ancient and most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>popular daily prayers, used in the daily Sandhyâvandana<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c017'><sup>[12]</sup></a>,
we find that one of them is the famous
Gâyatrî, addressed to Savit<i>r</i>i, the sun:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“We meditate on the adorable light of the divine
Savit<i>r</i>i, that he may rouse our thoughts.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This Savit<i>r</i>i, the sun, is, of course, more than
the fiery ball that rises from the sea or over the
hills, but nevertheless the real sun serves as a
symbol, and it was that symbol which suggested
to the suppliant the divine power manifested in
the sun. Hence almost everything that could be
predicated of the sun was predicated of Savit<i>r</i>i also,
whatever was true of the sky, Dyaus, fem., was
supposed to be true of Dyaus, masc., Zeus or
Jupiter also. As early an authority as Kâtyâyana
in his Index to the Rig-Veda declared that all the
gods invoked in the Vedic hymns can be reduced to
three, to Agni, fire and light, on earth, to Vâyu, air,
in the atmosphere, and to Sûrya, sun, in the sky, but
he adds that all three are in the end meant for one,
for Pra<i>g</i>âpati, the Lord of creation. And later on he
says, that there is only one deity, namely the Great
Self, Mahân Âtmâ, and some say that he is the sun,
(Sûrya), or that the sun is he. One of the prayers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>in the Sandhyâvandana begins with Asâv Âdityo
Brahma, that Âditya (sun) is Brahman, and in the
Taitt. Upanishad, VIII, 8, it is said: “He who
dwells in man and he who dwells in the sun, are
one and the same.” The same idea may be likewise
deduced from the hymns themselves. In X, 158, 1,
we read: “May the sun (Sûrya) protect us from the
sky, the wind (Vâyu) from mid-air, and fire (Agni)
from the earth;” whereas in another hymn, 115, 1,
we read: “the Sun is the Self or soul of all that
moves and rests.” Here we can clearly watch the
gradual transition from the visible sun to the invisible
agent of the sun which may have taken centuries
to evolve, and if we consider how almost everything
on earth is dependent on the sun for its very life,
we can understand how a perfectly natural road led
from the sun as seen in heaven, to the sun as the
highest, the supreme, nay, in the end, as the only
deity. This religious and philosophical development
of the concept of the sun did not, however, prevent
its simultaneous mythological growth. This is the
famous Solar Theory, which, no doubt, has been
much exaggerated, but which, if properly understood,
admits, we know, of cheap cavil, but never of refutation;
nay, which, if but rightly understood, has really
received more support from its supposed critics than
from its originators and supporters. One of the
most intelligible names given to the sun was A<i>s</i>va,
the racer, or Dadhikrâvan or Vâ<i>g</i>in, horse. And
while at one time the sun was a racer, at another the
sun was conceived as approaching men and standing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>on a golden chariot which was drawn by horses, as
in Greek mythology. Thus we read, Rig-Veda I,
35, 2: “The god Savit<i>r</i>i (the sun), approaching on
the dark-blue sky, sustaining mortals and immortals,
comes on his golden chariot, beholding all the worlds.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I have been assured that the noisy cannonade
which was directed for years against this explanation
of Vedic and Aryan mythology, was really
meant as a kind of salute; but I should have much
preferred a few twenty-pounders to test the solidity
of my entrenched position. When at last I was
charged with never having taken any notice of certain
illustrious critics, it seemed to me but courteous to
respond to that appeal. But there was really little
to answer because there was so little difference
between my critics and myself. They evidently
thought that I was opposed to their anthropological
theories, whereas on the contrary I rejoiced in them,
whenever they rested on scholarly evidence. I had
myself dabbled in the grammar of the Mohawk
and Hottentot languages, because I considered
grammar a <i>sine quâ non</i> of mythology, nor was I
much disturbed when my Sanskrit scholarship was
found fault with by critics who did not know the
Sanskrit alphabet. That real Sanskrit scholars
should have differed on certain etymologies, was
quite another thing, nor was it difficult to come to an
understanding with them. Either they were mistaken
on certain points or I was, but no real Sanskrit scholar
would ever join in the clamour of those who maintained
that Greek, Latin, and Teutonic mythology
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>had quite a different origin from that of the Veda.
Such things pass and are soon forgotten, and no
one who, like myself, remembers the time when
Bopp was laughed at by classical scholars for the
foolish idea that Greek and Latin grammar should
be explained by a comparison with Sanskrit would
be much disturbed by those who did not blush to
say that there was only one tenable equation between
the names of classical and Vedic deities, viz.
Dyaus = Zeus. But have those ready writers ever
reflected what such an admission would really mean,
and how it would disable the whole of their
machinery? What would happen if the name of
Jehovah, or even of Yahveh, turned up suddenly in
the Veda? Thinking is difficult, but it is sometimes
useful. Such things will be remembered hereafter
among the Curiosities of Literature. No one is
infallible, but because we have occasionally a fall
on the ice, it does not follow that we must not
skate or even cut figures on the ice. There is plenty
of work to do for those who are willing to work
either at the language of the Rig-Veda, or at that
of the Maoris, but without some of that grammatical
drudgery, I doubt whether mere assertions, or
repeating the opinions of others, will really forward
our knowledge of the <i>origines</i> of our own race.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is surely as clear as daylight to anybody who
will read a number of the hymns of the Rig-Veda
that they refer to the principal phenomena of nature,
and that in that respect they require no antecedents,
but are intelligible to any child. Yet for a number
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>of years there has been a constant outcry from
certain anthropologists, who asserted that the
Vedic hymns were modern in spirit, modern in
language, and modern in their pantheon, and that
this pantheon had nothing whatever to do with the
phenomena of nature, and had no relationship whatever
with the gods of the other Aryan nations,
particularly of Greeks, Romans, and Teutons. They
looked upon the Vedic religion as the last phase in
a development, the earlier stages of which had to
be studied among savage races, such as the <i>well-known</i>
Kamilaroi, Wiraturei, Waihvun, &#38;c. Have
they forgotten this? It is true, no doubt, that the
ideas expressed in the Veda presupposed a long
development, even a period of savagery, considering
that all civilised nations must once have been less
civilised, uncivilised, or even savages. There are
quite sufficient survivals of savagery even in the
Veda itself, only it is Aryan savagery, not savagery
of the Pacific Islanders, African negroes, or Dravidians.
If only some cases could be produced in
which the Australian blacks shared any of the ideas
of the Veda, or displayed similar ideas, only more
savage, every true scholar would welcome them with
open arms. Our expectations have been raised to a
very high pitch in that direction, and I still hope that
in time they may be fulfilled. In the meantime it is
fortunate that the mere clamour against the Veda
has at last subsided, so that now people only marvel
how it could ever have arisen.</p>

<p class='c006'>Most of the names of the Vedic deities implied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>at first activity only, but very soon personality also,
and what is most important, some of them were found
to be exactly the same in Sanskrit, in Greek, Latin,
German, and Slavonic, being only changed in every
one of these languages according to the phonetic
rules peculiar to each. Such verbal coincidences
had to be accounted for, and they could not be
accounted for except by the admission that there
was once a period, a truly historical period, during
which the framers of these mythological names and
the believers in these physical powers, or, as we are
accustomed to call them, these natural Gods or
Devas, were still living together as one language,
people or nation. Such an admission, inevitable as
it was in the eyes of all true scholars, roused at the
time a certain dislike and incredulity among those
who like to shrug their shoulders at every new
discovery. Forgetful of the fact that proper names
in all languages undergo certain phonetic changes
which do not apply to ordinary appellatives, they
thought they could belittle the value of such equations
as Sâramêya = <span lang="grc">Ἑρμείας</span>, Sara<i>n</i>yû = <span lang="grc">Ἐρινύς</span>,
Haritas = <span lang="grc">Χάριτες</span> by pointing out that strictly
speaking the Greek forms should have been
<span lang="grc">Ἑρεμείας</span> and <span lang="grc">Ἑρινύς</span>, while the Greek Charites,
though identical in names, seemed to resist all
efforts to trace them back to the same source from
which sprang the bright horses of the sun-god.</p>

<p class='c006'>This cheap scepticism, however, or, as it is now
called, this higher criticism, may safely be said to
belong to the past. I am old enough to remember
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>the conversion of such giants as Gottfried Hermann,
Otfried Müller, and Welcker to the principles of
scholarship, as taught by Bopp, Grimm, and others.
That was indeed a real triumph. In 1825, Otfried
Müller, the real founder of a scientific mythology
(<i>wissenschaftliche Mythologie</i>), was sighing for a
translation of the Rig-Veda. In 1899, when a great
part of it has been made accessible by the patient
labours of English, French, and German scholars,
some writers, who call themselves mythologists,
seem to take a pride in ignoring the existence of
the Veda. How far we have advanced since 1825,
may be gathered from a statement to which I should
be very sorry to affix a name, “that the only
generally accepted case of similarity between Vedic
and classical mythological names was that of Dyaush-pitar,
<span lang="grc">Ζεὺς πατήρ</span>, and Jupiter.” Has Benfey taught
in vain? Even in 1839, Benfey (<i>Wörterbuch</i>, II,
334) knew that Ushas was = Eos, Agni (fire) = ignis,
(ibid., II, 217), Sûrya = Helios (ibid., I, 458), to say
nothing of later equations which, even if disapproved
of, or disproved, would leave the general principles
of Comparative Mythology exactly as they were
fifty years ago. Has all this been forgotten, or
never been learnt?</p>

<p class='c006'>The discovery of Vedic literature which had
retained the clearest traces of a common Aryan
mythology, even if no equation besides that of
Dyaush-pitar = <span lang="grc">Ζεὺς πατήρ</span> had survived, was really
the discovery of a new world, of a <i><span lang="la">terra antiquis
incognita</span></i>, and gave us a glimpse at a whole period of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>thought, of which no relics whatever could be found
anywhere else, whether in Greece, Italy, or Germany.</p>

<p class='c006'>But highly interesting as these Vedic hymns are
to us, in spite of, or, I should say, on account of
their simplicity and childishness, anybody who came
to know them at first hand had to confess that they
seem quite unfit to satisfy the religious cravings of
a later generation. They contain praises of the
physical gods, they implore their help, they render
thanks for benefits supposed to have come from
their hands, light and life from Dyaus, rain and
food from a closely related power, called Indra,
warmth and light from Agni, new life every morning
from Ushas or Eos. All this is historically and
psychologically full of interest, but there is little
only, except here and there, of exalted religious
thought, of poetry or philosophy, still less of any
records of historical events. Besides, their language
is so difficult that, as yet, it makes a satisfactory
translation of the whole Veda a perfect impossibility.
This may seem surprising in the days when hieroglyphic
and cuneiform inscriptions have been so
readily translated. But the fact is that most of
those inscriptions are very straightforward, they
hardly contain a conditional or a relative sentence.
We read of Kings and Kings of Kings, of their
battles from year to year, of the towns they founded,
of the conquests they made, the captives they led
away, the tribute they received and so on, and yet
even such simple statements vary very considerably
from year to year according as they are translated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>by bold or timid scholars. The Vedic hymns on
the contrary, even when we understand every word
of them, remain very obscure in their structure or
construction; and though their texts are very
firmly established from the time they were first
reduced to writing and made the subject of the
most minute grammatical study in India, even
before the spreading of Buddhism, it is clear that
before that time, when the Vedic texts existed in
oral tradition only, they must have been exposed
to many vicissitudes. There are verbal emendations
so palpable that we can hardly understand
how the mistakes could have arisen, and could have
been tolerated for one moment. Besides that, there
are evidently old and new hymns, yet all of them
are recognised as belonging to the Veda, ever since
the Vedic hymns were systematically collected.</p>

<p class='c006'>The attempts that have been made to translate
the Vedic hymns may be divided into four periods.
The first consisted of those who followed Sâya<i>n</i>a’s
great Sanskrit commentary. This was the method
followed by Rosen in 1830 and 1838, and again,
in 1850, by H. H. Wilson. It was soon found
out, however, that highly useful, nay indispensable,
as the traditional interpretation of Sâya<i>n</i>a might be,
it was in many places quite impossible to follow
him, because the true meaning was too clear, and
that adopted by Sâya<i>n</i>a too absurd. Rosen already
used very freely the privilege of the scholar to
choose between what is rational and what is not.
Wilson had a stronger faith in Sâya<i>n</i>a, and gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>us in his translation the traditional rendering, even
where his own sound sense rebelled against it.</p>

<p class='c006'>There were others again who went into the other
extreme, and from sheer despair at Sâya<i>n</i>a’s commentary,
translated the Veda according to what they
thought it ought to mean. Langlois, a professor of
eloquence at Paris, carried this principle very far
indeed, yet we find that his translation is still
followed by some writers on ancient religion and
mythology.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the meantime a new school was slowly gaining
ground who held that the only satisfactory way of
translating the Veda was to construct, first of all,
a complete <i>Index Verborum</i><a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c017'><sup>[13]</sup></a>, to examine every
passage in which the same word occurs, and then
to assign that meaning to each word which would
satisfy the context wherever it occurred. I published
such an <i>Index Verborum</i> at the end of my edition
of Sâya<i>n</i>a’s commentary, and it is easy to see
the influence which it exercised at once on the
translations of the Rig-Veda which we owe to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>Grassmann, to Ludwig, and to Ralph T. H. Griffith,
and to others who tried their hands on single hymns
or single verses. Still greater was the influence
exercised by the Sanskrit Dictionary of Boehtlingk
and Roth, and the Vedic Vocabulary of Grassmann,
though, of course, neither the one nor the other
professed to give a complete index of every word
and every form in every passage in which it
occurred.</p>

<p class='c006'>The method which I recommended, and which
I followed in the specimens published (in 1859, in my
“History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature,” in 1869,
in the “Hymns to the Storm-gods,” and again in the
“Sacred Books of the East,” 1891), was so tedious,
however, that few scholars only felt tempted to
follow it. Professor Roth, the scholar most qualified,
through his lexical labours, to give us a real translation
of the Veda, was honest enough to say again
and again that such a work belonged to the next
generation of Sanskrit scholars, and to the next
century. I myself, having accepted the appointment
to a new professorship of Comparative Philology at
Oxford, had other things to do, and after I had given
the best part of my life to supplying the materials
necessary for such a task, I hoped that the ambition
of younger scholars would have been roused to
undertake this no doubt difficult, but very grateful
work. I did not go so far as to say, as has been
supposed, that every word, whenever it occurred,
should again and again be followed by every translator
through all its hiding-places. A number of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>words have once for all been fixed in their meanings,
and when that was the case, they were naturally
passed, as known to every Sanskrit scholar. Still
the mere physical exertion in collecting all parallel
passages became too much for me, and I had reluctantly
to give it up to younger and more vigorous
hands.</p>

<p class='c006'>We are now at the beginning of a new era in Vedic
scholarship whenever the Complete Concordance,
promised by Professors Bloomfield and Lanman,
shall have been published. This will be a gigantic
work, but it is really the <i>sine quâ non</i> for the Vedic
exegesis of the future, and we may expect much
help from it. But though many passages may be
unravelled by a more complete intercomparison, my
own impression is that, through the influence of a
long-continued oral tradition a great amount of real
corruption has crept into our texts which no amount
of conjectural emendation will ever entirely remove.
This may sound very discouraging, but fortunately,
after deducting ever so much that is hopeless, there
remains enough of the 1,017 hymns to give us
that insight into the first development of religious
thought in India and indirectly among the Aryan
nations in general, which is so full of interest to us
psychologically, even more than historically. So
many conflicting theories have lately been started
about the origin of religion, that it must seem to
many people as if, like other beginnings, that of
religion also was really beyond our grasp. But this
is to a great extent our own fault, because philosophers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>are bent on discovering the origin of religion,
instead of being satisfied with studying the origin of
religions, or of each individual religion with which it
is possible to do so, that is of which we possess old
literary documents. For that purpose the study of
the Veda is invaluable. But who would try to
discover the origin of Islam, without studying the
Korân? or of Buddhism without knowing the
Suttas? Who would offer an opinion about the beginning
of Christianity, unless he had read the
Gospels? Even then, it is well known how far
removed the Gospels are from the Nativity, and
the Korân from the Hejrah. But if we approach
the religions of Greeks and Romans, where shall
we find the Sibylline leaves telling us of their real
parentage? If there lived many heroes before
Agamemnon, there lived many poets and prophets
before Homer; but who can pierce through the
cruel darkness that hides them from our sight?</p>

<p class='c006'>And what shall we do when we have to deal with
religious customs and mythological lore of savage,
uncivilised, and illiterate tribes? A study of their
languages is no doubt an immense help towards
a correct understanding of their traditions; and we
cannot be sufficiently grateful to men like Hahn,
Codrington, Tregear, and others who did not shrink
from that drudgery, before writing on the myths or
customs of uncivilised tribes. The most useful
materials may be found where some popular poetry
has been preserved to the present day, as among
the Maoris or of some of the Ugro-Finnic tribes.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>It is well known how much labour has been spent
on establishing the date and the authenticity of the
Vedic hymns. Their authenticity is now admitted
by all Sanskrit scholars. Their date has been fixed
by me in my “History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature”
(1859) at about 1200 to 1500 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> But
though this date has met with very general acceptance,
I am the very last person to consider it as
firmly established, and I have again and again given
my reasons why I should gladly escape from the
force of my own arguments. If other scholars have
clamoured for a higher age, for 2000 or 5000 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>,
they are quite welcome to these dates if they can
establish them by any kind of historical evidence, and
not merely by their wishes; but as yet these guesses
are outside the sphere of practical scholarship, quite
as much as the date assigned by a Babylonian
scholar to the immigration of the Âryas into India,
so late as 500 or at the utmost 600 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>!</p>

<p class='c006'>But no literary or traditional documents which we
possess, whether in Greek or Latin or in any other
Oriental language, to say nothing of barbarous
dialects, bring us so near, if not to the origin, at
least to the early historical development of any
of the ancient religions of mankind as the hymns
of the Veda. If the study of single religions must
precede the study of religion in general, nowhere
can we get so near to the origin of any single religion
as in the hymns of the Rig-Veda. Other religions
may be older, and religion by itself may be beyond
all conception old, but no single religion, as far as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>I know, has been preserved in documents so old,
and so near to the very cradle of a religion as that
which we see growing before our eyes in the Veda.
Let those who want to know the origin of religion,
<i>a priori</i>, take refuge in metaphysics; but those who
care to understand the origin of one single religion
will find no better oracle to consult than the poems
of the Vedic Rishis.</p>

<p class='c006'>The chronological date of the Vedic hymns, which
has been fixed by some at 1200, by others at 2000,
nay at 4500 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, are, no doubt, very uncertain, and
can be no more than constructive. But though
Egyptian and Babylonian dates go far beyond any
date in India, we can see more of the real beginnings
of religion in India than even in Egypt or Babylon.
Nor would anybody accept the principle laid down
by students of the religion of savages, that whatever
is savage or barbarous in religion, must be old.
This is a major premiss that would play fearful
havoc with our chronology.</p>

<p class='c006'>What is quite clear is that, between the Vedic
hymns and the next period, that of the prose Brâhma<i>n</i>as,
there is a great gulf. The hymns of the three
Vedas had not only been collected, such as we have
them, but had already been invested with a divine
authority, such as is seldom ascribed to works of
recent date. Besides, it is clear that the language
of the hymns had often been completely misunderstood
by the authors of the Brâhma<i>n</i>as, and that
a new style had sprung up in the place of that of
the old poetical compositions. From the time of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>the Brâhma<i>n</i>as, which precede the rise of Buddhism
(500 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>), to the present day, the old hymns of the
Veda have retained their unique position in India.
Invested with the character of a divine revelation,
they have been to the people of India what the
Bible has been to us.</p>

<p class='c006'>And yet how different is this Bible of India from
all other Bibles! No doubt we meet in the Veda
with some exalted, and some very abstract ideas also,
but its general character is very different. It is
simple, straightforward, natural, without any attempt
at systematic treatment, without any effort for
poetical beauty. When we take day and night,
spring and winter, as they come and go, we shall
find in the hymns thoughts such as would naturally
spring up in the minds of any unsophisticated
observers who felt that there must be something
behind the visible world, some powers or persons
directing the course of nature, possibly some power
even beyond the powers, whom they called Devas
or Bright ones. It was chiefly the phenomena
which recurred regularly that impressed themselves
on their minds and evoked in time the idea of order
and law as pervading the whole of nature, even its
very thunderstorms and lightnings.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is hardly a language in which sun and
moon, day and night, dawn and fire have not received
their names, many of which, on account of their
multiplicity, led almost inevitably to mythological
metamorphosis. Anthropology has clearly shown
that the idea that exceptional events such as meteors,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>earthquakes, hurricanes, lightning, eclipses of sun
or moon, furnished the first impulses to religion and
mythology is no longer tenable, even though it has,
or rather seemed to have, the often quoted support
of Seneca. If we may judge by what has been
observed among uncivilised as well as civilised
races—for even civilised races must once have been
uncivilised—regularity attracts attention first and
irregularity follows, or, as it has been more tersely
expressed, the Gods come first, the Devils second,
though it is quite true that in later times Devil-worship
may have become more important, or, at
least, more prominent than the worship of the Gods.
Of these so-called prehistoric periods of human
thought, however, we must always speak with great
reserve. We must never forget that they are constructions
of our own, and that we shall never be
able to appeal to historical facts in support of our
theories. Facts are given us for the first time
during the Etymological Period of languages, and
afterwards, but at a much later time, by the scant
remains to be gathered from the Sacred Books of
the East. And here the Vedic hymns will always
hold their foremost place. However late we may
place this systematic collection, their composition
carries us back far beyond the chronological limits
reached by any other documents. And what gives
an additional interest to these Vedic fragments is
that they allow us an insight into the earliest development
not only of religion, but of mythology also. We
see superstitions springing up by the side of religion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>demons by the side of gods, agriculture by the side
of the chase, bows and arrows by the side of the
stone-weapons (A<i>s</i>ani), such as Indra hurled against
V<i>ri</i>tra in his fight against the powers of darkness.
Though the conception of the rainbow being the
bow of the god of the sky is not to be found in
the Rig-Veda, bows and arrows were well known
to the worshippers of the Vedic gods. The Science
of Mythology, after tossing about for centuries on
the ocean of mere conjectures, has at last found its
compass. We no longer see in it, like Bacon, mere
lessons of morality in the disguise of fables, or
broken rays of a primeval revelation, or misunderstood
fragments of the Old Testament, still less
recollections of a period of savagery to be studied
in the myths and customs of modern savages, or
survivals of a belief in amulets and magic incantations,
generally the very latest outcome of mythology
in its historical development, though I believe
there are still survivals of defenders of every one
of these time-hallowed theories. We know now, and
we know it chiefly from the lessons taught us by
the Veda, that our Aryan mythology, and to a
certain extent our ancient Aryan religion also, took
its origin from a poetical interpretation of the great
phenomena of nature, personified and named as the
chief agents of the eternal physical drama, enacted
before us every day, every month, every season,
every year, and we know also that this broad stream
of mythology, when once started, was open to ever
so many tributaries, superstitions, customs, vain genealogies,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>sorceries, idolatries of every kind, whether
springing from fancies and imaginations, or from
downright falsehoods and impositions. All these
things are apt to be absorbed by mythology, and
must be taken into account when we attempt a
scientific analysis of it. It must not be supposed,
however, that the attempt to find the key of Aryan
mythology in fetishism, totemism, shamanism, and
wherever it was <i>not</i> to be found, have been entirely
wasted. A reconnoitring party, even though it
return disappointed, has rendered real service by
showing where the enemy is not to be found, and
that service has certainly been rendered by the
exploring parties who thought they could discover
in Africa, America, or Australia what was ready
to hand in India, Greece, Italy, and among Celtic,
Teutonic, and Slavonic races.</p>

<p class='c006'>People continue to write as if there was still some
mystery about the Rig-Veda. There may have
been when we began, in the days of Rosen and
Burnouf, but there is no longer. The tools are
there, all that is now required is honest work, and
there is plenty of it, even if there were more real
labourers and not merely gleaners than we have at
present. It would be by no means difficult to put
together a number of hymns which would at once
settle the question by showing us the Hindu mind
such as it really was during the Vedic period, and
impressed by the grand sights of nature that passed
before it day and night.</p>

<p class='c006'>The same story is told again and again, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>wherever we open the Rig-Veda, the same daily
drama in its successive stages seems enacted before
our eyes. Some people, more particularly the late
M. Bergaigne, have been disconcerted by the many
allusions not only to the sights of nature, but to the
daily sacrifices also which occur in these hymns, but
they evidently did not realise that, however complicated
and technical the sacrifice had become
before the time when these Vedic hymns were
collected, there is nothing incongruous between
praise and sacrifice. Sacrifice was a very natural
occupation for the Vedic savages, as it is among
savages at the present day. Whether a man who
can describe the daily sunrise in artificial metres
belongs to a more primitive humanity than a man
who marks the stations of the sun, the phases of the
moon, or the return of the seasons to say his prayers
and pour out his libations, Sanskrit scholars would
gladly leave to members of Ethnological Societies
to determine. Whether the Veda is primeval or
not, is another question that may likewise be left
to those who know what primeval really means.</p>

<p class='c006'>The grave mistake to be guarded against is to
suppose that the Veda is an exclusively liturgical
book, monotonous throughout, and belongs therefore
to a late liturgical age. Savages, as ethnologists
themselves have told us, are often very punctilious
ritualists, and if we only consider how essential the
Vedic sacrificial system was to the Âryas of India
in determining times and seasons, in fact, in laying
the first foundations of a well-regulated society, we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>shall no longer be surprised at the numerous liturgical
allusions which occur in the Vedic hymns, nor
on the other hand see more of liturgy in them than
there really is. Whoever has read if only the first
hymn of the Rig-Veda<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c017'><sup>[14]</sup></a>, will know how many words
in it have a liturgical meaning, but nowhere have
those liturgical ideas obscured the original character
of the Vedic gods, as being the agents or actors in
the physical drama of nature which first made the
simple sons of nature ponder on the meaning of day
and night, of sun and moon, of earth and sky, in
fact of all that made them wonder, and turn their
thoughts beyond the horizon of the visible world.</p>

<p class='c006'>I think it may be best if I give here a few of
those Vedic hymns. They have a right to a place
among my Indian Friends. They have been with
me for many years. They have often roused me in
the morning, they have soothed me in the evening.
I have tried to make them out as one tries to make
out the character of a friend, even when at times
one feels puzzled with him. I have always trusted
them with good intentions, and if some of their
utterances for a long time remained dark and still
remain dark, are there not some dark corners in
most of our friends, nay, even in ourselves?</p>

<p class='c006'>It has been truly said that books are our best
friends. We see more of them than of any other
friends, and even if we get tired of them at times,
they are always ready to renew their friendship.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>People of the world may wonder what we can see
to attract us in such books as the Rig-Veda and
to keep us faithful to them to the end. But if they
tried, they would find that there are few of the great
books of the world which are not worth knowing,
and that there are many which deserve our friendship,
our love, and our lasting gratitude.</p>

<p class='c006'>I shall select these Vedic friends at random,
following, however, the guidance of an old grammarian,
Yâska, who tells us in what succession the
Vedic gods appear on the heavenly stage every
day, and particularly in the morning. It is in the
morning, when light and life return that the bright
beings, the Devas, are seen, and the daily revelation
of another world takes place, while the various aspects
of the new light are personified in the principal
gods of the Veda. The order in which they appear,
according to Yâska, is: A<i>s</i>vinau, day and night,
Ushas, dawn, Sûryâ, wife of the sun, V<i>ri</i>shakapâyî,
wife of V<i>ri</i>shakapi, doubtful, Sara<i>n</i>yû, early dawn,
Erinys, Savit<i>ri</i>, the enlivening sun, Bhaga, the sun
before sunrise, Sûrya, the risen sun.</p>

<p class='c006'>We begin with the two A<i>s</i>vins whom Yâska
places at the head of the daily procession of the
Devas, the Bright Ones.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>Hymn to the A<i>s</i>vins, Day and Night.</h3>

<p class='c012'>No Vedic gods have been so completely misunderstood
as these heavenly twins, and misunderstood
by the Brâhmans themselves. Still even these
misunderstandings are instructive. The A<i>s</i>vins were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>taken for a pair of horsemen, though it is well known
that riders on horseback occur very seldom in the
Veda, so that some scholars have wrongly maintained
that riding on horseback was altogether unknown in
Vedic times. The A<i>s</i>vins were taken by native
exegetes for old heroes or kings, and why they
should have formed part of the Vedic gods who
appear in the morning and the evening<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c017'><sup>[15]</sup></a>, was never
so much as asked. Besides, A<i>s</i>vin would be a very
strange name for rider, and would much rather
convey the meaning of a descendant or connection
of A<i>s</i>va, or A<i>s</i>vâ, i. e. the Horse, or the Mare, one
of the many mythological names, as we saw, of the
sun and the dawn. Being a couple the A<i>s</i>vins were
really the oldest representatives of the couple of
day and night, travelling always on their ordained
path from morning till evening, the same path on
which Agni also travels<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c017'><sup>[16]</sup></a> in his character of the light
of day. Thus they were very naturally mixed up
with many of the daily adventures of the Sun and
the Dawn<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c017'><sup>[17]</sup></a>. Dyaus is called the father of the
A<i>s</i>vins (Rig-Veda X, 61, 4), the Dawn their mother,
while under another name, as Sûryâ, she is represented
as the daughter of Savit<i>ri</i> and as the beloved
of the A<i>s</i>vins<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c017'><sup>[18]</sup></a>. Another poet says that the Dawn is
born, when the A<i>s</i>vins have harnessed their chariot,
and that Day and Night, again the A<i>s</i>vins, spring
from Vivasvat<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c017'><sup>[19]</sup></a>, the shining sun. As Sara<i>n</i>yû,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>Erinys, also is called the mother of the A<i>s</i>vins, she
must likewise have been another form of the Dawn
in her varying aspects.</p>

<p class='c006'>The stories about the A<i>s</i>vins when they have once
become mythological characters, heroes, saviours,
and physicians, are endless, but they need not detain
us. The important point is to perceive their physical
background, and that can always be discovered
even behind the thick veil of legend. Nothing is
more instructive for the student of mythology than
to see how this natural conception of Day and
Night, of Light and Darkness, as the A<i>s</i>vins,
becomes the germ from which spring in time ever
so many half-legendary and even half-historical
fables, the so-called Itihâras.</p>

<p class='c006'>Most of the hymns addressed to the A<i>s</i>vins are
very tedious, and repeat again and again the numerous
miracles which they performed and the kindnesses
which they showed to their friends and worshippers.
I give here one short hymn only (V, 76), enough,
however, to show what physical background there
was for them, a background which in many cases
had entirely vanished from the purview of the Vedic
Rishis, but which is clear enough to the student of
mythology.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have endeavoured in these translations to keep
strictly to the metre of the original, which is not
always easy. I must therefore crave the indulgence
of my readers for certain infelicities of expression
which I could not avoid without departing too much
from the original.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>If we remember that these twins were originally
meant for morning and evening, the process by
which they gradually became what they are in this
hymn and in other hymns more full of personal
legends, is most instructive to watch. That the
A<i>s</i>vins were originally meant for morning and
evening, or for the two halves of the diurnal twenty-four
hours, cannot be called in question, unless
another germ-idea is first suggested for them. But
then, is it not instructive to see how day and night
simply by being addressed in the second person
became personified, became human and even divine,
and were called by a name which would be unintelligible
unless we remembered that the sun had once
been called A<i>s</i>va, the runner, and that Asvâ, the
mare, had been used as a not uncommon name of
the Dawn. These beings who seemed to move on
the same daily path as the sun, or to have been
born of the Dawn, called A<i>s</i>vâ, were then called
the sons or friends of the Dawn, A<i>s</i>vinau, or the
horsemen, as representing the two phases of the
sun, or of the horse; or, as Yâska says, Nir. XII, 2,
the sun of night and the sun of morning. Their
three-wheeled chariot is golden, and in a single day
goes round heaven and earth. And when that first
metamorphosis had once been effected, when Day
and Night had once become a pair of runners, ever
returning to the same spot in the morning, almost
every blessing that comes from day and night,
particularly health and length of days, would
naturally be ascribed to them. Thus they gradually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>assumed the general character of saviours and
of physicians, and ever so many beings who were
rescued from dangers or from death, whether the
setting sun, or the setting moon, or the setting year,
were supposed to have been rescued by them.
Their chief work is to restore life, and to renew
youth, or to give sight to the blind. In many cases
the names of the heroes rescued or helped by them
speak for themselves, and leave no doubt, in the
minds of Sanskrit scholars at least, that they represent
physical phenomena, a fact admitted in this
case even by so great a sceptic as Bergaigne. Only
it must not be supposed that, because we can
explain some of their names, we ought to be able
to explain them all. The Brâhmans themselves
had long forgotten the original purport of these
names, and when that was the case, they did not
hesitate to give us as facts what were merely
their conjectures. As one of the characteristic
features of the A<i>s</i>vins was that they always returned,
Nâsatya, the returning (*<span lang="grc">νόστιοι</span> from <span lang="grc">νόστος</span>, homeward
journey) would seem a very applicable name.
But ancient grammarians quoted by Yâska, VI, 13,
explained it by Na + Asatya, not untrue, or by Nasikâprabhava,
born of the nose. Yet Yâska himself had
a very just perception of the nature of the A<i>s</i>vins.
He quotes various opinions of his predecessors who
saw in them heaven and earth, or day and night, or
sun and moon, or, lastly, two pious kings. Only this
is not a question so much of <i>aut—aut</i>, as of <i>et—et</i>.
They were all this, only from different points of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>view, and this comprehensiveness is one of the most
important features of ancient mythological thought.
However startling this may sound to those who form
their theories without any reference to historical
facts, it is really one of the most important keys
for unlocking the riddles of the most ancient periods
of mythology, and should be carefully distinguished
from what is meant by the syncretism of much later
times.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>Hymn to Ushas, Dawn.</h3>

<p class='c012'>Next follows Ushas, the Dawn, identical in name,
<i>pace</i> M. Reinach, with the Greek Eos. She is represented
as the most beautiful heavenly apparition
among the gods in their procession from East to
West. She is called the daughter of Dyaus, the
sister of Agni, also his beloved, according to the
changing aspects in which the sun of the morning
and the dawn presented themselves to the fancy,
of the Vedic poets. I subjoin the translation of

</div>

<p class='c006'>In spite of all the angry and ill-natured words of
M. Bergaigne, I ask once more whether this address
to the Dawn is not perfectly natural and intelligible.
Whether it required a priest to compose it, or
whether any father of a family could have done so,
who can tell? And who can tell whether the first
priest was not simply the father of a family, who
had his fire always burning on the domestic hearth,
and who felt grateful for the return of the dawn,
which coincided with the kindling of the fire on his
hearth? If the morning service was called Pûrvahûti,
what is that more than the early calling, Hûti
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>being derived from the same root, Hvê, from which
we had before Hot<i>ri</i>, the invoker, the priest.</p>

<p class='c006'>But whatever we may think on that point, it
seems perfectly clear that the different names by
which the Dawn is here addressed, Ushas, Ahanâ,
Dyotanâ, Dakshi<i>n</i>â, and Sûn<i>ri</i>tâ, were understood
as names of the Dawn. But will it be believed, that
when the Dawn is addressed in the very first verse
by the name of Dakshi<i>n</i>â, when her chariot is
mentioned, and her stepping forth out of darkness
to come to the morning-prayer of the people,
Mr. Bergaigne, always on the look-out for priest-craft
and ritual, sees in Dakshi<i>n</i>â, not the Dawn,
but <i>le salaire du sacrifice</i>? He thinks it not impossible
that <i>le salaire du sacrifice</i> might have been the
name of the Dawn, <i>considérée comme le don céleste
accordé pour récompense à l’homme pieux</i>. But he
declines even this small concession, and, if I understand
him rightly, he actually takes Dakshi<i>n</i>â in the
first and fifth verses of our hymn as the salary of
the priests. Now it is quite true that Dakshi<i>n</i>â
has this meaning of salary or gift due to the priest
who performs that sacrifice, but that meaning is
clearly impossible here. Our hymn contains several
unusual names of the Dawn, such as Ahanâ, Dyotanâ,
Sûn<i>ri</i>tâ, all <span lang="grc">ἅπαξ λεγόμενα</span>, as names of the Dawn,
then why not Dakshi<i>n</i>â? Dakshi<i>n</i>â means right,
<i>dexter</i>, evidently from Daksha, strength, the right
hand being the strong or clever hand. It then
means southern. It also means the cow, the strong
cow which has calves and gives milk (Dakshi<i>n</i>â
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>gâva<i>h</i>, Lâ<i>t</i>y. VIII, 5), and as such a cow was the
most primitive payment (<i>fee</i> and <i>pecu</i>), it may well
have become the regular name for the fee due to
the priest. She is celebrated as such in one of the
Vedic hymns, X, 107. But however prominent
a place may have been assigned to this Dakshi<i>n</i>â,
the salary of priests, how could the Dawn have
been called the salary? We can hardly explain
why even that salary was called Dakshi<i>n</i>â, unless
we suppose that it was meant for the right hand,
or <i>la bonne main</i>, and in that case Dakshi<i>n</i>â, Dawn,
might have been meant for the liberal goddess.
But whatever the evolution of the meaning of
Dakshi<i>n</i>â may have been<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c017'><sup>[32]</sup></a>, when she was invoked
as Dakshi<i>n</i>â, she could not have been invoked as
Salary. I am glad to see that even M. Bergaigne
has not been bold enough to translate “<i>Le large
char du Salaire a été attelé</i>,” but “<i>Le large char de la
Dakshi</i>n<i>â</i>.” If Dakshi<i>n</i>â were really in that sense an
<span lang="grc">ἅπαξ λεγόμενον</span>, surely it is not the only <span lang="grc">ἅπαξ λεγόμενον</span>
in the scanty survivals of Vedic poetry. When we
read that Dakshi<i>n</i>â was the daughter of Dyaus and
the mother of Agni (Rig-Veda III, 58, 1), we need
no more to feel convinced that she was meant for
the Dawn. Besides, who is the Putro Dakshi<i>n</i>âya<i>h</i>,
the son of Dakshi<i>n</i>â, if not Agni, the same who
brings Dyotani, Rig-Veda III, 58, 1? Another name
of the Dawn is Dyotanâ, and who can doubt that it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>meant the brilliant, i.e. the Dawn. More difficult
are the other names Ahanâ and Sûn<i>ri</i>tâ.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ahanâ is clearly connected with Ahan, day, just as
our dawn is connected with day. It has long been
known that day is not connected with <i>dies</i>, as was
formerly supposed, but that the root of Goth. dags,
day, can only have been dah, or dhah, with double
aspirate, to burn, to shine. The loss of an initial
d is no doubt quite irregular<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c017'><sup>[33]</sup></a>, though it can be
matched by Goth. tagr, Gr. <span lang="grc">δάκρυ</span>, tear, which in
Sanskrit appears as A<i>s</i>ru, instead of Da<i>s</i>ru. I pointed
out long ago, and I have never seen any valid
reason to retract it, that in the Greek <span lang="grc">δάφνη</span>, laurel
tree, the name of a matutinal goddess, we have the
root with its initial d, and that another derivation of
the same root, without the initial d, may be recognised
in Athanâ or Athênê.</p>

<p class='c006'>No one, I thought, could have supposed that
I meant to see in this Ahanâ one of the grandest
Greek goddesses, Athênê. Why will people so
often misunderstand, and then place their misunderstanding
on the shoulders of those whom they
misunderstand? When I said that Zeus is Dyaus,
that Eos is Ushas, that Agni is Ignis, surely I could
not have meant that these gods and goddesses
migrated bodily from India to Greece and from
Greece to India. Why must what seems perfectly
clear be said again and again, that the Greek and
Indian gods were not beings that ever existed in
heaven or on earth, but were mere names, mere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>creations of the human mind. In all comparative
mythological studies we have to look for the germs
only, and I see in Ahanâ and Athênê a common
germ, that withered on Indian soil, while it assumed
the grandest development in Greece.</p>

<p class='c006'>Surely not even Deva is the same as Deus; though
it may be the same sound, it does not represent the
same meaning, so that strictly speaking we cannot
translate the one by the other. The Greek
concept of Zeus also was very different from that
of the Vedic Dyaus, as that of Eos from that of
Ushas. I never went so far as to claim for Greek
and Vedic deities what might be called personal
or bodily identity. I was simply looking for germs
which after thousands of years might have developed
into a Sûrya in the Veda, and into a Helios in
Homer. These very modest claims may possibly
surprise my adversaries, for, to judge from their
remarks, they evidently imagined that I recognised
in Zeus a heavenly king who had migrated from
India to Greece, and in the Haritas the horses of the
morning who in their journey to Greece had been
metamorphosed into the brilliant children of Helios
and Aigle. I even begin to see why what some
critics supposed to have been my idea, should have
ruffled their temper so much, and I say once more,
and I hope for the last time, that I never believed
that Athênê lived in the thoughts of Vedic Rishis,
nor Varu<i>n</i>a in the prayers of Greek priests. No,
I am and always have been satisfied with far less.
All I stand up for is that, given the sky, the Greeks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>raised Dyu, sky, to become their Zeus, while the
Vedic Rishis made the sky their Dyaus. This
Dyaus is superseded in the Veda by his own son,
Indra, whereas Zeus in Greece remained to the
end the <span lang="grc">θεῶν ὕπατος καὶ ἄριστος</span>. What is common to
both is the word, that is, the concept of Dyaus, or
Greek Zeus, the sky as a person and as an agent.
I may not always have spoken quite guardedly, and
have taken certain things for granted which are
understood by themselves among scholars. The
important lesson is always the same. If Ahanâ is
phonetically identical with Greek Athanâ and if
Ahanâ is a name of the Dawn, it follows that the
first conception of Athênê was the Dawn and that, as
such, she sprang from the East or from the forehead
of Zeus or Dyaus, the sky. If in the Veda she
brings light and wakes and stirs up the thoughts
of men, she became in Homer also the goddess of
wisdom and the <span lang="grc">τεχνῶν μήτηρ πολύολβος</span>. All this
was perfectly known to Otfried Müller when in
1825 he wrote: “Because the name of the goddess
was originally a word of the language and always
remained so, Charis glided from poem to poem
and preserved by means of the word her general
meaning in every individual manifestation” (p. 249).</p>

<p class='c006'>Sûn<i>ri</i>tâ, another name of the Dawn, is more
difficult to explain. Sûn<i>ri</i>ta in the sense of true,
seems to me to have been formed in mistaken
analogy to An-<i>ri</i>ta<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c017'><sup>[34]</sup></a>, untrue, and to have meant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>originally true, then sincere, gentle, agreeable. As
applied to the Dawn it would have meant true, kind,
auspicious.</p>

<p class='c006'>But whatever obscurity there may still be left as
to the meaning of single words in our hymn, can
any one doubt that the whole of it was simply
an address or a prayer to the Dawn, without any
reference, as yet, to any complicated ceremonial, as
described in the Sûtras and Brâhma<i>n</i>as, and alluded
to in some of the hymns also? And why this
persistent searching for allusions to ceremonial?
No one ever denied the presence of real allusions
in the Vedic hymns. But it is a matter of degree,
a question of more or less, and these ceremonial
details, so far from proving our hymns to be very
modern and the work of professed priests, serve
only to prove, what was well known from other
sources also, that savage or uncivilised races adhere
at all times with great punctiliousness to their
ceremonial customs and traditions. M. Bergaigne
has done excellent work in pointing out traces of
the same punctiliousness among Vedic poets, but he
has allowed himself to be carried away much too
far by his own system, without either paying sufficient
attention to native commentaries or allowing
sufficient credit to his predecessors, particularly in
Germany. To speak of <i>ces philologues d’outre Rhin</i>,
is entirely out of place in the republic of letters,
and encourages a literary <i>chauvinisme</i> which will
never find favour with the best scholars of France.</p>

<p class='c006'>Leaving out Sûryâ, the female representative of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>the sun, and more or less a Dawn again, and V<i>ri</i>shâkapâyî,
because her character is not quite clear as
yet, and Sara<i>n</i>yû = Erinys, because she is only
mentioned in a few verses, we proceed now to
Savit<i>ri</i>, the rising sun. Though Savit<i>ri</i> is a name
applied to the sun in general, it is most frequently
used as the name of the rising and life- and light-giving
sun. Nor must it be supposed that Savit<i>ri</i>
is simply an appellative of the solar globe. Savit<i>ri</i>
has become a divine name or a divine <i>numen</i> as full
of life and personality as any other Deva. He can
therefore be asked, as he is in verse 9, to hale and
bring back the real sun. We shall easily recognise
his character in the following hymn (Rig-Veda I,
35, 2):—</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Is there one verse in this hymn that is not perfectly
clear and intelligible, as belonging to a hymn
addressed to the personified deity of the sun? Let
us once understand that Savit<i>ri</i> was a name of the
sun, and why should he not be invoked for protection
and for every kind of blessing? Of course,
as soon as the sun was addressed by a poet, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>ceased to be a mere sight. He became subjective,
personal, and human, whether we like it or not.
After that it does not require a great effort of
imagination to address him as standing on a golden
chariot, drawn by brilliant horses and all the rest.
Surely the Vedic poets stood not alone in indulging
in such imagery.</p>

<p class='c006'>The sixth verse is no doubt difficult to understand
in its minute detail, but its general sense is
clear, and we must remember that the whole verse
was really meant as a kind of riddle, a kind of
amusement in which uncivilised races all over the
world seem to have delighted.</p>

<p class='c006'>Everything else is exactly what any poet might say
of the sun. The sun might well be called a bird with
golden wings, and if he is thanked for the treasures
which he brings, surely the mere light of the
morning and the warmth of the day are treasures
sufficient for those whose very life must often have
depended on the return of light and warmth after a
cold and dark night, or on the return of spring after
a severe winter. I cannot think that even native
scholars could discover anything beyond what we ourselves
see in this hymn, and as to M. Bergaigne, he
must surely have been dazzled by his own system if
he could perceive many, nay, any allusions to a highly
developed system of sacrifice in any hymn like this.
That such allusions exist in other hymns, I am very
far from denying; what I deny is that liturgical
thoughts ever obscured the broad physical features
which formed the background of the ancient Vedic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>religion<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c017'><sup>[43]</sup></a>, nay, of the Vedic ceremonial also, built up
at first for the sake of regulating the times and
seasons of the year. I am the very last to deny
to M. Bergaigne and his pupils the merit of having
made the sacrificial system of the Vedic hymns more
intelligible, but they have not sufficiently resisted
the temptation of trying the key that opened one
drawer, on all the drawers that still remained to be
unlocked.</p>

<p class='c006'>These hymns would suffice for the gods of the
morning, and may help to open the eyes of our
mythological Parâv<i>rig</i>as, who cannot see the light
because there is too much of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>I shall, however, add one more matutinal hymn
addressed to Agni, not simply as the fire, but as
the god of light which brightens the world every
morning, and is in fact very difficult to distinguish
from the sun. This Agni is sometimes called the
first of all the gods. The word itself is the general
name of fire in Sanskrit. It is phonetically the
same as the Latin <i>ignis</i>, though the change of a
into i is phonetically irregular. No one, however,
is likely to be so bold an agnostic as to deny that
the Âryas, before they separated, had made the discovery
of fire, and given a name to it, such as Agni
or <i>ignis</i>. What is most interesting in the development
of this word is that while in India it entered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>into a very rich, religious, and mythological career,
it remained a simple appellative in Italy, and was
almost entirely lost and forgotten among the other
Aryan nations. Should we be justified then in
saying that the Latin <i>ignis</i> cannot possibly be the
same word as Agni, because the latter is one of
the greatest gods in the Veda, while <i>ignis</i> is no
god at all? In the Veda Agni is a most prominent
deity, though his character has often been misunderstood.
Agni was, no doubt, the fire on the hearth
and on the altar, and as such had his own development
in India<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c017'><sup>[44]</sup></a>. But Agni was also light in general,
and more especially the light of the sun, whether
in the morning, or at noon, or in the evening.
Thus we read, Rig-Veda III, 28, 1:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Agni, accept our offering, the cake, at the <i>morning libation</i>!</div>
      <div class='line'>Agni, eat the cake offered to thee when the <i>day is over</i>!</div>
      <div class='line'>Agni, accept here the cake at the <i>midday libation</i>!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Here Agni is clearly the sun, or the sunlight, or
some power dwelling in the sun, all of which are
very natural ideas with people in a nomadic or
even agricultural state of society, nor do the three
daily libations seem to me to point to any elaborate
ceremonial. They are hardly more than the beginnings
of the Sandhyâvandana and they could
easily be matched among Semitic, nay, even among
savage races.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>In many hymns the solar character of Agni is
merged in his domestic character, as the fire on
the domestic hearth, as the centre of each family.

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>Now, I ask once more, can anything be more
simple and natural? And can we not, without any
great effort on our part, transport ourselves into the
position of the Vedic poet who uttered these words,
and follow his thoughts, as he gazed on the rising
sun? No one would suppose that this poet was the
first on earth who ever addressed the rising sun, and
that it was he who coined all the names by which
the sun is addressed in these short songs. We can
easily see what a long distance lies behind him,
behind his words and behind his ideas. He was
certainly not the first who invented priests and their
sacrificial work. Only let us remember that, if we
use such terms as priest or high priest, or king,
we must not allow ourselves to assign to these
terms, however unconsciously, all the meanings
these words have with us.</p>

<p class='c006'>These are very important cautions for people
ignorant of Sanskrit, who have been led to imagine
that the Vedic Âryas had kings like Solomon or
Louis Quatorze, or High Priests like Samuel or
Bossuet. The word which I translate by priest,
is hot<i>ri</i>, which meant originally no more than
shouter or invoker, and which in due time became
the technical name of one of the sixteen <i>Ri</i>tvi<i>g</i>as
or Season-priests. The other word Purohita means
<i>praepositus</i>, or provost, and was at first no more
than the priest who had to assist or to replace the
father of a family, and had to see that all the offerings
to the gods were made at the proper times and
seasons, which probably was in the beginning no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>more than a contrivance for marking the essential
divisions of the year.</p>

<p class='c006'>Much depends here, as elsewhere, on the words
which we use. Every act of worship may be called
a sacrifice, and every sacred poet a high priest. To
us these are very grand names and full of meaning.
But let us look at some of the hymns addressed to
Agni which are called sacrificial, and it seems to me
that any peasant in his own cottage could have performed
what is called a sacrifice, as presupposed, for
instance, in the following hymn (Rig-Veda II, 6).</p>

<p class='c006'>But whether these so-called sacrifices were in
the beginning as complicated as they certainly were
in the end, they are perfectly intelligible, and probably
will become much more so when we know
more of the literature in which they are described.
How much of their development is presupposed in
the Vedic hymns, I tried to explain, however shortly,
as long ago as 1859 in my ‘History of Ancient
Sanskrit Literature,’ p. 468, and much has been
added by others during the last forty years; but
when we speak of Vedic sacrifices, we must not
think of the temple at Jerusalem, or of St. Peter’s,
but of a small plot of grass, on which a fire was
kindled within the walls of piled up turf, and kept
alive by pouring butter or fat upon it.</p>

<p class='c006'>What is far more instructive in these hymns is
the general attitude of the poet towards the sights
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>of nature which attracted his attention, and the
transition from a mere description of nature such
as he saw it, to its being peopled with persons whom
we call either divine or mythological. Here it is
where the Veda has proved so useful, and has given
quite a new character to the study of ancient religion
and ancient mythology in every part of the world.</p>

<p class='c006'>How much ingenuity was spent in former days
to discover the origin of Zeus and the Greek
dwellers on Olympus! After opening the Veda
all becomes clear. What doubt can there remain
that Zeus was Dyaus, originally the sky, but not
the sky as the blue vault of heaven, but the sky
as active, as personified and divine? We cannot
expect to find many such cases as that of Dyaus =
Zeus, where an Aryan god has preserved not
only his old character in India and Greece and
Italy, but his name, and that almost unchanged.
We saw how the name of Agni was altogether lost
in Greece, though preserved as an appellative in
Italy. Yet the Greeks also had their god of fire,
and their gods of light, such as Hephaestos, Apollon,
Dionysos, Hermes and others, each developed in
his own way. And here we come across some
curious reminiscences among the Aryan nations.
We saw how Agni, as morning sun, was called the
son of heaven and earth. In other hymns he is
actually called Dvimâtâ, having two mothers. This
strange name meets us again in Greek Dimêtôr,
in Latin as Bimatris. The child of two mothers
or parents, a name quite intelligible, as we saw, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>Sanskrit, as the son of heaven and earth, had become
unintelligible in Greek and Latin, so that every
kind of myth was invented to account for so strange a
name. To say that the deity called Dvimâtâ in the
Veda was the same as the Greek Dimêtôr or the
Latin Bimatris would be going too far; but to say
that Dimêtôr, i.e. Dionysos (*Dyu-ni<i>s</i>ya) was originally
a god of light, as much as Agni, as much as
Apollon, and Hermes, the son of heaven and earth,
is perfectly right and helps us to account for a
number of myths in classical mythology.</p>

<p class='c006'>These more hidden influences of ancient Aryan
mythology on that of Greeks and Romans, are often
the most interesting. We have a similar case in
Jupiter Stator, which is generally explained as the
stopper, stopping the soldiers from running away.
That may be the Roman explanation, but in the
Veda we have the same word Sthâtâ, applied to Indra,
first as Sthâtâ harî<i>n</i>âm, i.e. holder of horses, when
he comes in his chariot; then as Sthâtâ rathasya,
holder or governor of his chariot. When this origin
was once forgotten, it would be not unlikely that
a new meaning was discovered in Stator, viz. the
preserver of law and order, or the keeper in battle.</p>

<p class='c006'>If Agni, as in hymn X, 1, is identified with
Vish<i>n</i>u, i. e. the sun in the zenith, we see how
pliant the ideas of gods still were in the Veda. This
Vish<i>n</i>u in India became in time as independent a
deity as Apollon and Dionysos ever were in Greece,
but they were all conceived as in the beginning
sons of heaven and earth, and as closely allied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>with the sun in its various manifestations. The
Vedic poet saw no difficulty in recognising the
same elementary power in the sun rising in the
morning, culminating at noon, and vanishing at
night, nay in the fire on the hearth, and in the
fire of the sacrifice, as the divine guest, the friend
of the family, the priest on the altar. All this
is not the Solar Theory, it is the Solar Fact, and
not easily to be disposed of by an ignorant smile.
Though Sanskrit scholars differ as much as other
scholars, the broad facts of the Solar Theory have
never been called in question by any competent
authority, I mean, by anybody acquainted with
Greek and Latin, and a little of Vedic Sanskrit.</p>

<p class='c006'>While Agni here appears before us as the god
of light in general, and often begins the procession
of the daily gods as the light of the morning, as
chasing away the dark night, as holding aloft the
radiant sun, as leading forth the daughter of Dyaus
(<span lang="grc">Διὸς θυγάτηρ</span>), that is the Dawn, he being represented
sometimes as the brother of the Dawn, sometimes
as her lover<a id='r57'></a><a href='#f57' class='c017'><sup>[57]</sup></a>, once even as kissing her<a id='r58'></a><a href='#f58' class='c017'><sup>[58]</sup></a>, there are
other deities, equally representative of light, but
more specialised in their functions. Sûrya himself,
the Greek Helios, appears among the Vedic deities,
and Ushas (Eos), the dawn, is called Sûrya-prabhâ
or sunshine.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have so far watched the daily procession
of the Vedic gods as reflected in the hymns, beginning
with Agni, as god of light, especially the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>light of the morning, and in many respects the
<i>alter ego</i> of the sun. We saw that in one sense
the Dawn also is only a female repetition of the
auroral Agni (Agnir aushasya), and we met with
a third personification of the morning sun in the
shape of Savit<i>ri</i>, who is perhaps the most dramatic
among the solar heroes, such as Mitra, Âditya,
Vish<i>n</i>u and others.</p>

<p class='c006'>The procession of the matutinal gods, which
we have followed so far under the guidance of
our old grammarian, Yâska, can be shown to rest
on even earlier authority. Thus we read in one
of the hymns themselves, Rig-Veda I, 157, 1:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Agni awoke, from earth arises Sûrya,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ushas, the great and bright, throws heaven open,</div>
      <div class='line'>The pair of A<i>s</i>vins yoked their car to travel,</div>
      <div class='line'>God Savit<i>ri</i> has roused the world to labour.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>There are other hymns, of course, that refer
to the light of day or to the sun in his later stages
also, culminating as Vish<i>n</i>u, or setting with T<i>ri</i>ta,
till at last Râtrî, night, appears, and Varu<i>n</i>a, the
coverer, reigns once more supreme in heaven.
When we see Varu<i>n</i>a together with Mitra, the
sun-god, they represent a divine couple, dividing
between them the sovereignty of the whole world,
heaven and earth, very much like the A<i>s</i>vins. They
are not so much in opposition to each other, as
partners in a common work.</p>

<p class='c006'>Just as the night, the sister of the Dawn, is sometimes
conceived as a dawn or day (Ahan) herself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a also seem often to be charged
with the same duties. They hold heaven and
earth asunder, they support heaven and earth and
are the common guardians of the whole world.
Varu<i>n</i>a as well as Mitra is represented as sun-eyed.
Still the contrast between the two becomes
gradually more and more pointed, and we can
clearly see that, while light and day become the
portion of Mitra, night and darkness fall more
and more to the share of Varu<i>n</i>a. The sun is
said to rise from the abode of Mitra and Varu<i>n</i>a,
but night, moon, and stars are mentioned in the
hymns already, as more closely related to Varu<i>n</i>a.
Thus we read, Rig-Veda I, 27, 10:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The stars fixed high in heaven and shining brightly</div>
      <div class='line'>By night, Oh say, where have they gone by daytime?</div>
      <div class='line'>The laws of Varu<i>n</i>a are everlasting,</div>
      <div class='line'>The moon moves on by night in brilliant splendour.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In Rig-Veda VIII, 41, 10, we ought surely to
translate, “He made the white-clothed black-clothed,”
and not, as proposed, “He made the
black-clothed white-clothed,” a change which is
never ascribed to Varu<i>n</i>a.</p>

<p class='c006'>This explains why some scholars went so far
as to recognise in Varu<i>n</i>a the original representative
of the moon or of the evening star, a far too
narrow conception, however, of that supreme deity,
though true, no doubt, so far as Varu<i>n</i>a, like the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>sky, comprehends within his sphere of influence
night and stars as well as sun and dawn. The
almost perfect identity of name between Varu<i>n</i>a
and Ouranos shows that Varu<i>n</i>a was not only a
Vedic or Indian deity, but had been named already
in the Aryan period. There are phonetic difficulties,
but how should we account for the coincidences in
the name and character of these two gods?</p>

<p class='c006'>These few specimens of Vedic poetry will suffice,
I hope, to show what is meant by the Solar Theory.
It means that most of the physical phenomena
which impressed the mind of primitive races, like
those that have left us their religious utterances in
the Veda, were connected with the sun, with the
light of the morning, with day and night succeeding
each other, and regulating the whole life of an
agricultural population. What else was there to
interest such people and to draw away their
thoughts from a visible to an invisible world? If
I have sometimes called that population uncivilised,
what I meant was that we come across customs,
such as the selling of children or offering them as
victims, polygamy, possibly even polyandry, which
are generally considered as signs or survivals of
savagery. Such general terms, however, are often
very misleading, and because in the Râ<i>g</i>asûya sacrifice,
for instance, there are remnants of disgusting
customs, we must not allow ourselves to indulge
with certain so-called missionaries in a general condemnation
of the Vedic ceremonial. We should
rather learn the lesson that ceremonial is generally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>the accumulation of centuries, and contains, besides
much that may be useful, a large quantity of old
rubbish, mostly misunderstood, muddled, and complicated,
till the meaning of it, if it ever had any, is
lost beyond the hope of recovery.</p>

<p class='c006'>If anybody, after reading these few hymns, selected
quite at random, can still doubt whether the Solar
Theory is the only possible theory to account for
these Vedic deities, and in consequence, for the
Aryan deities connected with them by name or
character, I have nothing more to say. I doubt
the existence of such a person. He must in very
truth be a solar myth. Let me say once more
that I have never looked upon all Vedic deities as
solar or matutinal, but that other physical phenomena
also, such as rivers, clouds, earth, night, storms, and
rain had been personified or deified before these
hymns could have been composed. It is true there
is one hymn only addressed exclusively to the Night
(X, 127), two only addressed to the Earth, but
I pointed out before why such statistics, though
very tempting, are altogether untrustworthy and have
nothing whatever to do with the real importance or
popularity of these deities. Does the ninth Ma<i>nd</i>ala
of the Rig-Veda, with its 114 hymns almost
entirely addressed to Soma, prove the supreme
popularity of Soma as a member of the Vedic Pantheon?
However, to guard against all possibility
of misapprehending my purpose, here follows the
hymn to Râtrî or Night; which can hardly be called
solar in the usual sense of that word.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We must remember that the night to the Vedic
poet was not the same as darkness, but that on the
contrary, when the night had driven away the
day, she was supposed to lighten the darkness, and
even to rival her sister, the bright day, with her
starlight beauty. The night, no doubt, gives peace
and rest, yet the Dawn is looked upon as the
kindlier light, and is implored to free mortals from
the dangers of the night, as debtors are freed from
a debt. Many conjectural alterations have been
proposed in this hymn, but it seems to me to be
intelligible even as it stands.</p>

<p class='c005'>One more hymn to show how the belief in and
the worship of these physical gods, the actors behind
the phenomena of nature, could grow naturally into
a belief in and a worship of moral powers, endowed
with all the qualities essential to divine beings.
Moral ideas are not so entirely absent from the
Veda, as has sometimes been asserted, and nothing
can be more instructive than to watch the process
by which they spring naturally from a belief in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>gods of nature. I give the hymn to Varu<i>n</i>a from
Rig-Veda VII, 86, which I translated for the first
time in my “History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature”
in the year 1859, and which, with the help of other
translations published in the meantime, I have now
tried to improve and to clothe in the metrical form
of the original.</p>

<p class='c006'>I wish I could have introduced a larger number
of my so-called Indian friends, the poets of sacred
songs who may have lived thousands of years ago.
But I am afraid I have already tired out the patience
of my readers with these very ancient friends of
mine. The only excuse I can plead is that my own
friends in England and in Germany have so often
wondered how I could have fallen in love with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>Veda, and actually left my own country in order
to rescue this forgotten Bible from utter oblivion.
It is fortunate that people have different tastes and
that we are not all devoted to the same beauty.</p>

<p class='c006'>One more hymn I must add, however, for I am
afraid if I do not, I shall be accused of having misrepresented
the character of the Veda, as reflecting
only the simplest thoughts of shepherds and cultivators
of the land. I have remarked several times
before that the Rig-Veda contains some very striking
philosophical passages, and how far some of the
Vedic poets must have been carried by purely metaphysical
speculations may be seen by a hymn which
I translated for the first time in my “History of
Ancient Sanskrit Literature,” 1859. In putting it
into a metrical form I was helped at the time by
my departed friend, the late Archbishop of York,
then Mr. Thomson, and I am glad to say I find
little to alter in his translation even now.</p>

<p class='c006'>This hymn is important, not only by what it says,
but by what it presupposes. Whatever date we
may ascribe to it as incorporated in the Rig-Veda,
many generations of thinkers must have passed
before such questions could have been asked or
could have been answered. As yet we see the
Vedic age only as through a glass darkly. The
first generation of Vedic scholars is passing away.
It has done its work bravely, though well aware
of its limits. Let the next generation dig deeper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>and deeper. What is wanted is patient, but independent
and original work. There is so much new
ground still to be broken, that the time has hardly
come as yet for going again and again over the
same ploughed field.</p>

<p class='c006'>I must now part with my Vedic Friends. I can
hardly hope that I have persuaded many of my
English friends to share my feelings for my antediluvian
acquaintances. All I care for is to make
others understand how my heart was caught, and
what I saw in my Indian love, not only in her
Vedântic dreams and aspirations, but in the simplicity
of her earliest utterances of trust in powers
invisible, yet present behind what is visible, and in
her faith in a law that rules both the natural and
the supernatural world.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>MY INDIAN FRIENDS.<br> <br> V.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c011'>A Prime Minister and a Child-wife.</h3>

<p class='c012'>I have often had to give expression to a certain
disappointment at not being able, when speaking of
my Indian friends, to reveal more of their inner life.
That life, we may be certain, is not absent, but it is
kept hidden, just as Indian women are kept behind
their purdahs or curtains and hidden under veils,
more or less transparent. Some of our own distinguished
men and women are perhaps too much
given to perform their confessions and moral ablutions
in public, while in India such books as Rousseau’s
<i>Confessions</i>, or the <i>Confessions of St. Augustine</i>, nay,
of Amiel or Marie Bashkirtseff, to mention some
well-known instances only, can hardly be imagined.
Introspection or self-examination exists no doubt
among the men and women of India as well as anywhere
else. But unless such inward searchings take
a definite form in words, nay, in written and published
words, they can hardly be said to exist. A man
may enter into a dark cave and see visions, but
unless he can find his way back into the bright
light of day, unless he can find words for what was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>vaguely passing through the twilight of his memory,
all vanishes again and leaves nothing behind but
a nameless sentiment, like the feeling that is left
by a dream, when we know indeed that we have
been dreaming, but cannot recall what we saw in
our dreams.</p>

<p class='c006'>Even in the prayers which we possess of the
people in India we find no very deep delvings into
the soul of man. They consist chiefly of praises of
the greatness of the gods or of God, of general
confessions of human weakness or sin, but we hardly
ever come across the agonised sufferings of self-reproachful
saints, and we see little of that moral
vivisection which, painful as it is to witness, often
reveals to us some of the most secret springs of
human nature which nothing else will bring to our
view.</p>

<p class='c006'>I cannot, therefore, even in the two cases of
Indian friends which I have selected for my purpose
here, promise anything like that minute moral and
spiritual analysis which we find in the works of
St. Augustine, of Rousseau, or Marie Bashkirtseff.
One of my friends belonged to the highest, the
other to the lowest ranks of Indian life; the one
was a Prime Minister, the other what we should
call a poor peasant-girl. I was brought into contact
with them, not indeed face to face, but by correspondence
only. The Prime Minister was the well-known
Gaurîshankar Udayshankar Ozá, Minister of Bhavnagar.
I am afraid that when people see these long
and unpronounceable names they will at once put
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>down the book. Names such as Rudyard Kipling,
Bashkirtseff, or Pobedonostzeff may be mastered in
time, but Gaurîshankar Udayshankar Ozá is too much
for most people’s memories; and how can people, even
if they manage to pronounce such a name, attach
any meaning whatever to it? It might be better,
perhaps, to give the name in its Sanskrit form, viz.
Gaurî-<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>kara; we could then see some kind of
meaning in it, provided we knew a little of Sanskrit.
So far as one may guess the meaning of any proper
names, Gaurî-<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>kara would be the name of the
divine couple, <i>S</i>iva, sometimes called <i>S</i>a<i>m</i>kara, and
Gaurî, better known under the name of Pârvatî,
his wife. Of course the name may be interpreted
differently also, but when we know that Gaurî stands
for Pârvatî, and Shankar for <i>S</i>iva, we move at once
in more or less familiar spheres, and we may look
on the name as something like the Christian name
Joseph Maria, which is not unusual as a Christian
name in Roman Catholic countries. But when I call
Gaurî-<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>kara the well-known Prime Minister of
Bhavnagar, I anticipate another shrugging of the
shoulders. What is Bhavnagar, where is it, and
what is there really known about its “well-known”
Prime Minister? Here are our difficulties, when
we want to rouse the sympathies of our readers
for anything connected with India. Yes, if Gaurî-<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>kara
of Bhavnagar were Fergus McIvor, chief of
Glennaquoich, all would go well. But to most
people, except those who have been in India, Bhavnagar
is almost a <i>terra incognita</i>, and as there are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>now no separate postage-stamps for the independent
states of India, even children would say that there
is no such state as Bhavnagar anywhere. Still there
is a native state of that name in Kathiawar, with
about 500,000 inhabitants, and there is a Râjah,
who is called the Thakur Sahib of Bhavnagar.
There is also a town of Bhavnagar, the capital of
the state. Like most of the protected Rajput states,
Bhavnagar enjoys as much freedom as is compatible
with the welfare of its neighbours and the imperial
interests of India. Under such conditions conflicts
are, no doubt, inevitable, and it required no little
statesmanship in the Râjah, and in his Dewân, or
Prime Minister, to reconcile the interests of their
subjects with those of their neighbours and with
those of the British Empire. Quite a new class of
native statesmen seems to have sprung up of late
in these various dependent states, who are enabled,
through the moral support which they receive from
the Central Government, to reform the abuses of
a personal and autocratic <i>régime</i>, to revive education,
and to improve the sanitary condition of the
towns and villages, to open commercial communications,
and altogether to raise the political and moral
status and character of the people committed to their
charge. In many cases they had at the same time
to keep on good terms with the English residents,
who are not always the most amiable, and to protect
the Râjahs themselves against the corrupting influences
of their little courts and harems. Taking
all this together, it is not difficult to see that their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>position was by no means an easy one, and that it
required high qualities indeed in these native statesmen
to enable them to hold their own, to satisfy the
claims of all the parties with whom they had to deal,
and at the same time not to stifle the voice of their
own conscience.</p>

<p class='c006'>But when an opening had once been made for
native talent in this direction, native talent was not
wanting. The names of such men as Sir Salar Jung
in Hyderabad, Sir T. Madao Rao in Travancore,
Indore, and Baroda, Sir Dinkar Rao in Gwalior, are
well known, not in India only, but in England also,
and not the least successful among them was our
friend Gaurî-<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>kara.</p>

<p class='c006'>With all the narrow prejudices of Oriental society,
particularly in India, there was always a <i>carrière
ouverte aux talents</i>. Gaurî-<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>kara was the son of
a poor man, though he belonged to a good Brâhmanic
family. His education would not, perhaps,
have enabled him to pass the Indian Civil Service
Examination, and yet what an excellent Civil servant
would he have made. Examinations prevent many
evils, but they cannot create or even discover the
qualities necessary for a ruler of men.</p>

<p class='c006'>Like Mr. Gladstone, Gaurî-<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>kara became known
in India as the Grand Old Man, or, better still, as
the Good Old Man, and, like Mr. Gladstone, he
represented in himself a striking combination of the
thinker and the doer, of the meditative and the
active man. His deepest interest lay with the great
problems of human life on earth, but this did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>prevent him from taking a most active part in the
great and small concerns of the daily life and the
daily cares of a small state. He acted as Minister
to four generations of the rulers of Bhavnagar,
and he was a constant referee on intricate political
questions to successive Political agents of Kathiawar.
He could remember the first establishment of British
authority in the Bombay Presidency, and he had
been the contemporary and fellow-worker of Mountstuart
Elphinstone at the time when the settlement
of Guzarat and Kathiawar had to be worked out
between the Gaikwar on one side and the English
Government, as successor of the Peshwa, on the
other. He came in contact not only with Mountstuart
Elphinstone, who visited Kathiawar in 1821,
but with Sir John Malcolm also, with Lord Elphinstone
and Sir Bartle Frere—nay, as late as 1886,
with Lord Reay, then Governor of the Bombay
Presidency. After a conference with the old man—he
was then eighty-one years of age, having been
born in 1805—Lord Reay declared that he was
struck as much by the clearness of his intellect as
by the simplicity and fairness and openness of his
mind; “and if we admire administrators,” he added,
“we also admire straightforward advisers—those who
tell their chiefs the real truth about the condition of
their country and their subjects. In seeing the man
who freed this State from all encumbrances, who
restored civil and criminal jurisdiction to their
villages, who settled grave disputes with Junaghad,
who got rid of refractory Jemadars, I could not help
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>thinking what could be done by such men of purpose
and strength of character.</p>

<p class='c006'>These words contain a rapid survey of the work
of a whole life, and if we were to enter here into the
details of what was actually achieved by this native
statesman we should find that few Prime Ministers
even of the greatest states in Europe had so many
tasks on their hands, and performed them so boldly
and so well. The clock on the tower of the Houses
of Parliament strikes louder than the repeater in our
waistcoat pocket, but the machinery, the wheels
within wheels, and particularly the spring, have all
the same tasks to perform as in Big Ben himself.
Even men like Disraeli or Gladstone, if placed in
the position of these native statesmen, could hardly
have been more successful in grappling with the
difficulties of a new state, with rebellious subjects,
envious neighbours, a weak sovereign, and an all-powerful
suzerain, to say nothing of court intrigues,
religious squabbles, and corrupt officials. We are
too much given to measure the capacity of ministers
and statesmen by the magnitude of the results
which they achieve with the immense forces placed
at their disposal. But most of them are very
ordinary mortals, and it is not too much to say
that for making a successful marriage-settlement a
country solicitor stands often in need of the same
vigilance, the same knowledge of men and women,
the same tact, and the same determination or bluff
which Bismarck displayed in making the treaty of
Prague or of Frankfurt. Nay, there are mistakes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>made by the greatest statesmen in history which,
if made by our solicitor, would lead to his instant
dismissal. If Bismarck made Germany, Gaurî-<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>kara
made Bhavnagar. The two achievements are
so different that even to compare them seems absurd,
but the methods to be followed in either case are,
after all, the same; nay, it is well known that the
making or regulating of a small watch may require
more nimble and careful fingers than the large clock
of a cathedral. We are so apt to imagine that the
man who performs a great work is a great man,
though from revelations lately made we ought to
have learnt how small—nay, how mean—some of
these so-called great men have really been.</p>

<p class='c006'>Gaurî-<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>kara found nothing to begin with—or
rather, less than nothing, for he found not only an
unorganised but a disorganised state. General
Keatinge, who was Political Agent of Kathiawar
during the years 1863 to 1867, found the transformation
that had been wrought by Gaurî-<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>kara
so complete that he could hardly believe that Bhavnagar
was the same town which he had known in
former days. Splendid buildings had arisen, devoted
either to education or to the relief of the sick, the
poor, and the needy. The harbour had been improved,
and roads for trade and communications
of every kind had been newly laid out or made
serviceable. There was a large reservoir to supply
the town with water; there were paddocks, a new
jail, two medical dispensaries, and an immense
hospital; there were telegraph and post offices, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>High School, and a High Court of Justice. A
railway had been built from Bhavnagar to Gondal,
and so well was it administered, without syndicates
or any other kind of jobbery, that it yielded annually
a fair revenue to the state. The responsibility for
all these undertakings rested on the shoulders of one
man, and the credit for them should rest there also.</p>

<p class='c006'>All this, however, is not what interested me in
the old man, nor will it, I fear, interest many of my
readers. He is after all but one of the many unknown
ants that build up hills which, for all we
know, one stroke of a stick may destroy again.
Nor was it his moral character, noble and pure as it
doubtless must have been, that riveted my attention
chiefly. A man could hardly have achieved what
he did, unless he stood high above the reach of the
vulgar vices and failings of mankind. In that
direction, I may quote a few more judgments from
the mouths of those who had known him during his
long active life. “His chief strength,” as one of his
friends writes, “was to be found in his exemplary
private character—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“His words were bonds, his oaths were oracles,</div>
      <div class='line'>His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate;</div>
      <div class='line'>His tears pure messengers sent from his heart;</div>
      <div class='line'>His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>This is beautifully expressed; but does it give us
an image of the man himself? Even the strongest
words seem so colourless when they are meant to
give us the picture of a living man. It may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>quite true that he enjoyed in private and domestic
life a veneration that was due to his noble and
patriarchal character, and that his influence was, as
we are told, invariably and unerringly exerted in
putting an extinguisher on private feuds and disagreements
among a wide and ever-widening circle
of relations, friends, and members of his caste. We
read that “in order to promote harmony among them
he often made personal sacrifices, and that he proved
himself a friend of the needy and the helpless, of
genius and talent struggling to rise. If it was not
to be a blessing to others, life seemed to him not
worth living.”</p>

<p class='c006'>All this is very strong testimony; and yet of how
many people has the same been said, particularly by
mourners at the grave of one whom they loved, and
who had loved them! Funeral eloquence has its
bright, but it also has its very dark side. It is
delightful to see how much can be forgotten and
forgiven at the grave, how gently all faults can be
passed over or accounted for, how none but the
noblest motives can then be imputed. But all is
spoiled at once if rhetorical exaggeration comes in,
so that even the truth contained in the panegyrics
is hidden and choked by a rank growth of adulation
and untruthfulness.</p>

<p class='c006'>But though I was quite prepared to believe all
that we were told about the private as well as public
character of Gaurî-<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>kara, what attracted me most
in him was that the same man should through life
have been a true philosopher, nay, what men of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>the world would call a dreamer of dreams; and
should yet have proved so excellent a man of
business. Plato’s dictum, which has so often been
ridiculed, that philosophers are the true rulers of
men, has indeed been signally vindicated in Gaurî-<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>kara’s
case. And his philosophy was not what
may be called useful philosophy—a knowledge of
nature and its laws. This might be tolerated in a
Prime Minister, even in Europe. No; it consisted
in the most abstruse metaphysics which would turn
even the hardened brains of some of our best
philosophers perfectly giddy. And yet that very
philosophy, so far from unfitting Gaurî-<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>kara for
his arduous work, gave him the proper strength
for doing and doing well whatever from day to
day his hands found to do. He felt the importance
of his official work to the fullest extent, but he
always felt that there was something more important
still. Though devoting all his powers
to this life and its duties, he felt convinced that
this life would soon pass away, that there was no
true reality in it, that it was Mâyâ, illusion, arising
from Avidyâ, nescience, and that there was behind,
beneath, and above, another and higher life which
alone was worth living. It was his faith in, or his
knowledge of, that higher life which best fitted him to
perform his work in the turmoil of the world. Thus
it was that when any of his schemes ended in failure,
disappointment never upset him, and that though
he was often deceived in the friends he had trusted,
he never became a pessimist.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>It is very difficult to describe what was the faith
or the philosophy which supported him throughout
his busy life. From his early youth he was impressed
with certain views of the Vedânta philosophy,
which form the common spiritual property, so to say,
of all the inhabitants of India. That philosophy
seems to have entered into the very life-blood of the
nation, but it assumed, of course, very different
forms as believed in by men of talent and education,
and by the drudging tillers of the soil throughout
the land. The number of those who study the
Vedânta in the works of such minute philosophers as
Bâdarâya<i>n</i>a and <i>S</i>a<i>m</i>kara is naturally very small, but
the number of those who have drunk in the spirit
of it, it may be in a few sayings only, is legion.</p>

<p class='c006'>It seems almost impossible to give a short and
clear account of that ancient philosophy, though, when
once known, it can be, and has been, described and
epitomised in a few very short lines. The approaches
to it are very various, but anybody accustomed to
Greek or European forms of thought is sorely perplexed
how to find an entrance into it from exactly
the same point as the Hindus themselves. The
Vedânta philosophy is meant to be an interpretation
of the world, different from all other interpretations,
whether philosophical or religious. It was to lead
to a new birth, and therefore remained unintelligible
and unmeaning to souls that will not be regenerated.
It is partly an advantage, partly a disadvantage, that
for several of their most important tenets the
Vedântists simply appeal to the Vedas, their Bible,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>as containing the absolute truth, as being the highest
seat of authority, or the last Court of Appeal on
questions which with us would require very different
arguments to prove that, given our reasoning powers,
such as they are, and the world, such as it is, certain
doctrines are inevitable, or that at all events their
opposites are unthinkable. To make the results
at which the Vedântists arrive intelligible, it is best
for us to start with a few maxims which seem to
underlie their philosophy, and which, whether true
in themselves or not, do not at all events offend
against our own rules of reasoning.</p>

<p class='c006'>If, then, we start with the idea of the Godhead,
which is never quite absent in any system of
philosophy or religion, we may, excluding all polytheistic
forms of faith, allow our friends, the
Vedântists, to lay it down that before all things
the Godhead must be one, so that it may not be
limited or conditioned by anything else. This is
the Vedânta tenet which they express by the ever-recurring
formula that the Sat, the true Being or
Brahman, must be Ekam, one, and Advitîyam, without
any second whatsoever. If, then, it is once admitted
that in the beginning, in the present, and in the
future, the Godhead must be one, all, and everything,
it follows that nothing but that Godhead
can be conceived as the true, though distant cause
of everything material as well as spiritual, of our
body as well as of our soul. Another maxim of
the Vedântist, which likewise could hardly be gainsaid
by any thinker, is that the Godhead, if it exists
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>at all in its postulated character, must be unchangeable,
because it is perfect and cannot possibly be
interfered with by anything else, there being nothing
beside itself. On this point also all the advanced
religions seem agreed. But then arises at once
the next question, If the Godhead is one without
a second, and if it is unchangeable, whence comes
change or development into the world; nay, whence
comes the world itself, or what we call creation—whence
comes nature with its ever-changing life and
growth and decay?</p>

<p class='c006'>Here the Vedântist answer sounds at first very
strange to us, and yet it is not so very different from
other philosophies. The Vedântist evidently holds,
though this view is implied rather than enunciated,
that, as far as we are concerned, the objective world
is, and can only be, <i>our knowledge</i> of the objective
world, and that everything that is objective is <i>ipso
facto</i> phenomenal. Objective, if properly analysed,
is to the Vedântist the same as phenomenal, the
result of what <i>we</i> see, hear, and touch. Nothing
objective could exist objectively, except as perceived,
by us, nor can we ever go beyond this, and come
nearer in any other way to the hidden, subjective
part of the objective world, to the <i>Ding an sich</i>
supposed to be without us. If, then, we perceive
that the objective world—that is, whatever we know
by our senses, call it nature or anything else—is
always changing, whilst on the other hand, the one
Being that exists, the Sat, can be one only, without
a second, and without change, the only way to escape
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>from this dilemma is to take the world when known
to us as purely phenomenal, i.e. as created by our
knowledge of it, only that what we call knowledge
is called from a higher point of view not knowledge,
but Avidyâ, i.e. Nescience. Thus the Godhead,
though being that which alone supplies the reality
underlying the objective world, is never itself objective,
still less can it be changing. This is illustrated
by a simile, such as are frequently used by
the Vedântists, not to prove a thing, but to make
things clear and intelligible. When the sun is
reflected in the running water it seems to move
and to change, but in reality it remains unaffected
and unchanged. What our senses see is phenomenal,
but it evidences a reality sustaining it. It is, therefore,
not false or illusory, but it is phenomenal. It
is fully recognised that there could not be even
a phenomenal world without that postulated real
Sat, that power which we call the Godhead, as
distinguished from God or the gods, which are its
phenomenal manifestations, known to us under
different names.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Sat, or the cause, remains itself, always one
and the same, unknowable and nameless. And what
applies to external nature applies likewise to whatever
name we may give to our internal, eternal,
or subjective nature. Our true being—call it soul,
or mind, or anything else—is the Sat, the Godhead,
and nothing else, and that is what the Vedântists
call the Self or the Âtman. That Âtman, however,
as soon as it looks upon itself, becomes <i>ipso facto</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>phenomenal, at least for a time; it becomes the I,
and that I may change. The I is not one, but
many. It is the Âtman in a state of Nescience,
but when that Nescience is removed by Vidyâ, or
philosophy, the phenomenal I vanishes in death,
or even before death, and becomes what it always
has been, Âtman, which Âtman is nothing but the
Sat, the Brahman, or, in our language, the Godhead.</p>

<p class='c006'>These ideas, though not exactly in this form or
in this succession, seem to me to underlie all Vedântic
philosophy, and they will, at all events, form
the best and easiest introduction to its sanctuary.
And, strange as some of these ideas may sound
to us, they are really not so very far removed from
the earlier doctrines of Christianity. The belief in
a Godhead beyond the Divine Persons is clearly
enunciated in the much-abused Athanasian Creed,
of which in my heart of hearts I often feel inclined
to say: “Except a man believe it faithfully, he
cannot be saved.” There is but one step which the
Vedântists would seem inclined to take beyond
us. The Second Person, or what the earliest
Christians called the Word—that is, the divine idea
of the universe, culminating in the highest concept,
the Logos of Man—would be with them the <i>Thou</i>,
i.e. the created world. And while the early
Christians saw that divine ideal of manhood realized
and incarnate in one historical person, the Vedântist
would probably not go beyond recognising that
highest Logos, the Son of God and the Son of man,
as Man, as every man, whose manhood, springing from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>the Godhead, must be taken back into the Godhead.
And here is the point where the Vedântist differs
from all other so-called mystic religions which have
as their highest object the approach of the soul to
God, the union of the two, or the absorption of the
one into the other. The Vedântist does not admit
any such approach or union between God and
man, but only a recovery of man’s true nature,
a remembrance or restoration of his divine nature
or of his godhead, which has always been there,
though covered for a time by Nescience. After
this point has once been reached, there would be
no great difficulty in bringing on an agreement
between Christianity, such as it was in its original
form, and Vedântism, the religious philosophy of
India. What seems to us almost blasphemy—a
kind of <i>apotheosis</i> of man, is with the Vedântist
an act of the highest reverence. It is taken as
man’s <i>anatheosis</i>, or return to his true Father, a
recovery of his true godlike nature. And what
is or can be the meaning of God-like? Can anything
be godlike that is not originally divine, though
hidden for a time by Nescience? After all, though
Nescience may represent Manhood as the very
opposite of Godhead, what beings are there, or can
be imagined to be, that could fill the artificial
interval that has been established long ago between
God and man, unless we allow our poets to people
that interval with angels and devils? The real
difficulty is how that interval, that abyss between
God and man, was ever created, and if the Vedântist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>says by Nescience, is that so different from what
we say “By human ignorance”?</p>

<p class='c006'>It was necessary to give these somewhat abstruse,
explanations—though in reality they are not abstruse,
but intelligible to every unsophisticated and childlike
mind. These, then, were the ideas that supported
our friend Gaurî-<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>kara, and which support, under
different disguises, millions of human beings in
India—men, women, and children. On such simple
but solid foundations it is easy to erect ever so
many religions, to build ever so many temples, and
to find room for the most elevated and the most
superstitious minds, all yearning for the same Peace
of God, and for the same Giver of Peace and Rest.
Names may differ and truth may adopt different disguises.
But, after all, the peace which Gaurî-<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>kara
enjoyed amid the daily cares of his official life, and
which arose from his forgetting himself and finding
himself in God, or, as he would say, forgetting his
phenomenal in his real Âtman, could it have been
so very different from what we call the peace of God
that passes all understanding? Such a view of the
world as his was, is generally supposed to unfit a man
for all practical work, but this, as we see, is by no
means a necessary consequence. One thought of
Brahman was sufficient to refresh and strengthen
him for the battle of life, like a header taken into the
waves of an unfathomable ocean. He knew where
he was and what he was, and that was enough to
keep him afloat.</p>

<p class='c006'>And here we come across another curious feature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>of Hindu life, which shows how thoroughly their
philosophy had leavened and shaped their social
institutions in ancient times. As soon as we know
anything of these institutions we read that the passage
through life of a twice-born man was divided into four
periods—one of the pupil, Brahma<i>k</i>ârin, the next
of the married man or the householder, G<i>ri</i>hastha.
Then followed the third stage, after a man had
fulfilled all his duties, had performed all necessary
sacrifices, and had seen the children of his children.
Then and then only came the time when he might
retire from his house, give up all that belonged
to him, and settle somewhere in the forest near,
with or without his wife, but still accessible to his
relations, and chiefly occupied in overcoming all
passions by means of ascetic exercises, and withdrawing
his affections more and more from all
the things of this life. During that third station,
that of the Vânaprastha or the <span lang="grc">ὑλόβιος</span>, the mind
of the hermit became more and more concentrated
on that higher philosophy which we call religion,
and more particularly on the Vedânta, as contained
in the Upanishads, and similar but later works.
Instead of merely dipping into the waters, the
philosophical baptism became then a complete
submergence, an entrance into life with Brahman,
where alone perfect peace and a perfect satisfaction
of man’s spiritual desires could be found. This
third station was followed by a fourth—the last
chapter of life, when the old and decrepit man
dragged himself away into the deep solitude of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>forest, forgetting all that had once troubled or
delighted his heart, and falling at last into the arms
of his last friend, Death.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such a conception and division of life seems quite
natural from a Hindu point of view, and there was
no necessity therefore for explaining it, as some
anthropologists have done, by a circuitous appeal to
savage customs, as is now the fashion. It is well
known, no doubt, that both savage and half-civilised
races get rid of their old people by either killing
them or by causing them to be killed by wild
animals. This inhuman cruelty may, no doubt,
have been an act of necessity, particularly during
a nomadic state of life. But in India the third
station of life is quite different. It is based on
a voluntary act, and it is followed by a fourth and
final station, equally chosen by a man’s own free
will. Besides, all this was meant for the higher
classes only, without a hint of its ever having been
considered as inhuman or cruel. These anthropological
explanations are very amusing, no doubt;
their only drawback is that most of them can neither
be proved nor disproved.</p>

<p class='c006'>At present the four stations of life in India seem
to possess an archaeological interest only, they are
no longer of any practical importance. In the case of
Gaurî-<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>kara it was no doubt his love of the ancient
customs of his country, combined with a true desire
for rest at the end of a most laborious and most
successful career, that made him think of reviving
in his own case the old custom, though even then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>in a milder form only. He gave up his post as
Prime Minister, and entered into private life in
January, 1879. His mind, we are told, when he was
bordering upon eighty, was as bright and active
as ever, but he then directed all his mental energies
to one subject only, to a constant contemplation of
the great problems of life. His presence had
attracted many itinerant anchorites, many eminent
teachers and students of the Vedânta to Bhavnagar,
which became for a time the home of Indian philosophical
speculation. He himself now devoted his
time to a serious study of Sanskrit, for which his
incessantly busy career had left him little time in
youth. He published in 1884 <i>The Svarûpânusandhâna</i>
in Sanskrit, being considerations on the nature
of the Âtmâ (Self), and on the unity of the Âtmâ
with the Paramâtmâ (the Highest Self). He still
saw some friends, and, living in what we should
call a garden house, he remained in touch with
the outer world, though no longer affected by any
of the conflicting interests which had occupied
him for so many years. When, in 1886, Lord and
Lady Reay wished to see him once more, he consented
to receive them, but in the dress, or rather
uniform, of his Order, with his Dhoti, his frock, and
his cap all covered with ochre. Their interview
lasted for an hour, and Lord Reay declared that
of all the happy moments he spent in India, those
spent in the presence of that remarkable man remain
engraved on his memory.</p>

<p class='c006'>A few letters which I received from the old man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>after his retirement from the world may be interesting.
He had sent me a copy of his book which
contained, as he said, a collection of Vedântic
sentences, forming, as it were, a chain of precious
jewels or pearls. I thanked him in the same spirit,
and as my letter has been published in his Life,
I may as well repeat it here:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Oxford</span>, <i>December 3, 1884</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“I have to thank you for your kind letter and for
your valuable present, the Svarûpânusandhâna. If
you had sent me a real necklace of precious stones
it might have been called a magnificent present,
but it would not have benefited myself, my true
Âtman. The necklace of precious sentences which
you have sent me has, however, benefited myself,
my true Âtman, and I, therefore, consider it a far
more precious present than mere stones or pearls.
Besides, in accepting it, I need not be ashamed,
for they become only my own, if I deserve them,
that is, if I truly understand them. While we are
still in our first and second Â<i>s</i>rama (station of life)
we cannot help differing from one another according
to the country in which we are born, according to
the language we speak, and according to the Dharma
(religion) in which we have been educated. But
when we enter into the third and fourth Â<i>s</i>rama,
into which you have entered and I am entering, we
differ no longer, G<i>ñ</i>âtvâ Deva<i>m</i> sarvapâ<i>s</i>âpahâni<i>h</i>,
‘When God has become really known, all fetters fall.’</p>

<p class='c016'>“Though in this life we shall never meet, I am
glad to have met you in spirit.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>I received another letter from him when he was
just on the point of retiring from the world altogether
and becoming a Sa<i>m</i>nyâsin, as far as that is possible
in modern India. By taking this step he showed
that he was indeed a Vedântist in good earnest.
What with us is but one of the many theories of
life, was to him the only saving faith; and while
with us an old Prime Minister clings to the end to
his political interests, and loves to be surrounded
and amused by those who belong to him, we see
here a real hero of thought who, freed from all
desires, turns his eyes away from the whole phenomenal
world to dwell only on what is eternal and
unchangeable, the Paramâtman—the Highest Self.
To most of us this intellectual atmosphere, which
he breathed to the very last, would prove too exhausting.
We can never drop all fetters—nay, many
of us glory in them to the very end. But whatever
we may think of his philosophy, there can be no
doubt that his life was consistent throughout. He
tried to live up to the standard which had been
handed down to him from remote antiquity, and
which he fully believed to be the best and the
truest. This last letter is dated July 11, 1886. In
it he says:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“I had sent you a book which is the result of
my long study of the Vedânta Philosophy. You
can easily imagine that I, being a Hindu Brâhman,
can be said to have fully realized the truth of the
doctrine therein discussed, when I can give you
patent proofs of the effect which that study has had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>on me. There are, as you well know, four Â<i>s</i>ramas
prescribed by our <i>S</i>âstras, and the Brâhmans are
required to successively pass through them all, if
they can do so. But in this Kaliyuga people are
not very particular about it. The second Â<i>s</i>rama,
namely that of G<i>ri</i>hastha (householder), is more
or less enjoyed by all, and there are some who
enter into the third or fourth order. Fortunately
for myself I have attained an old age by which
I was enabled to fulfil the requirements of the
<i>S</i>âstras, and thus lead a life of the third order after
I left public life.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now my health is failing fast, and to finish the
whole I have made up my mind to enter into the
fourth order or Â<i>s</i>rama—namely, that of Sa<i>m</i>nyâsin.
Thereby I shall attain that stage in life when I shall
be free from all the cares and anxieties of this world,
and shall have nothing to do with my present circumstances
in life.</p>

<p class='c006'>“After leading a public life for more than sixty
years, I think there is nothing left for me to desire
except the life of a Sa<i>m</i>nyâsin, which will enable
my Âtman (Self) to be one with Paramâtman (highest
Self), as shown to us by the enlightened of old.
When this is accomplished a man is free from births
and rebirths; and what can I wish more than that
which will free me from births and rebirths, and
give me means to attain Moksha (freedom)?</p>

<p class='c006'>“My learned friend, in a few days I shall be a
Sa<i>m</i>nyâsin, and thus there will be a total change
of life. I shall no more be able to address you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>in this style, so I send you this letter to convey
my best wishes for your success in life, and my
regards, which you so well deserve.</p>

<p class='c006'>“After this, as you have so well said in your note,
you and I will be not two persons, and as the Âtman
which, being all-pervading, is one, there is total
absence of duality. I shall end this note with the
same words which you have mentioned, G<i>ñ</i>âtvâ
Deva<i>m</i> sarvapâ<i>s</i>âpahâni<i>h</i>, ‘When God has been
known, all fetters fall.’”</p>

<p class='c006'>I heard no more of him except indirectly, when
his son sent me a copy of the Bhagavad-gîtâ as
a present from his father, who was no longer Gaurî-<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>kara
then, but Sa<i>kk</i>idânanda, that is, the Supreme
Spirit, i.e. he “who is, who perceives, and is blessed.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It would be a mistake to imagine that a life such
as was lived by Gaurî-<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>kara is usual in modern
India. On the contrary, it is now quite exceptional,
and Gaurî-<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>kara was in every respect an exceptional
character. Still we must guard against a
mistake made by many biographers, who represent
their hero as standing alone on a high pedestal
without any other people around him with whom
he could be compared. We have of late had a
number of biographies that would make us believe
that in England great men differed by their whole
stature from their contemporaries. It is but seldom,
however, that we find one man a whole head taller
in physical stature than the majority; and so it is in
intellectual and moral height also. It is true that
it is the head that makes the whole difference,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>and sometimes a very great difference, still we must
never forget that, as a mountain peak seldom stands
up by itself, even our greatest men are surrounded
in history by their equals, and should be measured
accordingly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus in our case, though in Gaurî-<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>kara we see
a rare union of the man of the world and the man
out of the world, of the Prime Minister and the philosopher,
it so happens that there were several other
statesmen living at the same time who, if they had
not actually become hermits, were, all their life,
devoted students and followers of the Vedânta.
The Minister of the neighbouring state of Junagadh,
Gokulaji Zâlâ, who had likewise made his way from
poverty to the highest place in his little kingdom,
was all his life devoted to the study of the Vedânta.
He was the personal friend of Gaurî-<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>kara, and
in the reports of the Political Agent he is spoken
of as the equal of Gaurî-<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>kara<a id='r62'></a><a href='#f62' class='c017'><sup>[62]</sup></a>. Lord Lytton
conferred on him the title of Râo Bahâdur, in recognition
of his loyal conduct and services. When he
died, in 1878, too young to have become a Sa<i>m</i>nyâsin,
it was said that “having done his task, he became,
through the true self-knowledge, free from the three
forces—causal, subtile, and gross—which disguise the
Self, and that his Self, absorbed in the highest Self,
became all happiness, just as space, enclosed in a
vessel, becomes one with infinite space and force,
as soon as the vessel is broken.” Everywhere we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>come across the same Vedântic thoughts in India,
though, no doubt, under various forms, according
to the comprehension of different classes, but in
their essence they all mean the same. Gokulaji
himself, if we may judge by his biographer, was an
assiduous student of the Vedânta all his life, perhaps
more even than Gaurî-<i>s</i>a<i>m</i>kara had been; and, while
the latter rejoiced more in the ancient abrupt Vedântic
utterances of the Upanishads, Gokulaji had evidently
taken an interest in the modern Vedânta also, which
enters more minutely into many of the problems
which are but stated<a id='t261'></a> or hinted at in the ancient
Upanishads.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the case of the two Prime Ministers of Bhavnagar
and Junagadh there can be little doubt that the
Vedântic spirit which filled their minds and guided
their steps in life was drawn from a study of the
classical works in which that ancient philosophy has
been preserved to us. They were Vedântists, as
even with us Prime Ministers may be Platonists
or Darwinians. But the same philosophical spirit
has entered into the language of the people also,
into their proverbs and popular maxims, into their
laws and poetry. If people, instead of saying “Know
thyself,” can only say “Know Âtman by Âtman”
(know self by self) they are reminded at once of
the identity of the ordinary and higher Self. If
they meet with people who called themselves Âtmârâma,
i.e. self-pleased, they are easily led on to
see that the name was really meant for delighting
in the Self, i. e. God; if they are taught that he who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>sees himself in all creatures, and all creatures in
himself, is a self-sacrificer and obtains the heavenly
kingdom, they learn at least that this Self is meant
for something more than the material body or the
Ego, though it can no doubt be used in that sense
also.</p>

<p class='c006'>This Vedânta spirit pervades the whole of India.
It is not restricted to the higher classes, or to men
so exceptional as the Prime Minister of Bhavnagar.
It lives in the very language of the people, and
is preached in the streets and in the forests by
mendicant Saints. Even behind the coarse idol-worship
of the people some Vedântic truth may
often be discovered. The “Sayings of Râmak<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a,”
which I lately published (“Râmak<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a, His Life
and Sayings,” 1898), are steeped in Vedântic thought,
and the life-spring of the reforms inaugurated by
such men as Rammohun Roy, Debendranâth Tagore,
and Keshub Chunder Sen, must be sought for in
the Vedântic Upanishads, though quickened, no
doubt, by the spirit of the New Testament.</p>

<p class='c006'>How omnipresent the influence of the old Vedânta
is, even in the lower strata of Indian society, I can,
perhaps, show best if I repeat here a story which
I have told once before, the story of a poor little
girl and her boyish husband. I came to hear that
story through her friends who were the friends of
Keshub Chunder Sen. We must try to understand,
first of all, that it is possible in India for a girl
of nine and a boy of twelve to fall in love and to
be married, or, rather, to be betrothed. To us such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>a state of things seems most unnatural; but as long
as the custom prevails and is looked upon with
favour rather than with disapproval, we can hardly
blame a young peasant boy and a still younger peasant
girl for following the example set them by their
father, mother, and all their friends. That hearts
so young are capable of mutual affection and devotion
we know from the biographies of some of our
own most distinguished men. Nay, we are told
by the people of India that the years of their boyish
love form the happiest years of their life. As a
rule, these young couples remain for some time
with their relations—they are like brother and sister;
and as they grow up they have the feeling that,
like their father and mother, brothers and sisters,
husband and wife also are given, not chosen, and
the idea that the bonds of their betrothal could ever
be severed never enters their minds. The custom
itself is no doubt both objectionable and mischievous,
and those who have laboured to get it abolished by law
deserve our strongest sympathy. All I wish to say
here is that we must not make an innocent, ignorant
couple, living in an Indian village, responsible for
the perversity of a whole nation.</p>

<p class='c006'>How perverse a nation can be may be seen from
an Indian newspaper calling itself <i>The Indian Nation</i>,
which first denies that Hindu widows are unhappy,
and then adds “that, according to Hindu ideas, they
ought to be unhappy, because the end of life is not
happiness, nor the gratification of dreams, but the
regulation, or, if possible, the extinction of them.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>The widow’s life, we are told, was not meant to
be joyful, nor should it be rendered joyful or useful,
because Hindu ethics are not utilitarian like ours.</p>

<p class='c006'>These two, <i>S</i>rîmatî and her husband Kedar Nâth,
were as happy as children all day long; but what is
even more surprising than their premature marriage
is the premature earnestness with which they looked
on life. Their thoughts were engaged on questions
which with us would seem but rarely to form the
subject of conversation, even of far more mature
couples. They felt dissatisfied with their religion
which, much as we hear about it in Indian newspapers,
occupies after all a very small portion only
of the daily life of a poor Hindu family. Their
priest may come to say a few prayers before their
uncouth idol, provided they possess one, there may
be some popular rather than religious festivals to
attend, and charitable contributions may be extorted
by the priests even from those who have barely
enough to eat themselves. They wear their sectarian
mark on the forehead, and they may repeat a few
simple prayers learnt from their mothers. But of
religion, in our sense of the word, they know little
indeed. Even when there is a sacred book for their
own form of faith, Vedas, Purâ<i>n</i>as, or Tantras, they
probably have never seen or handled it. They
are surrounded, however, by temples and idols, and
repulsive idolatrous practices are apt to sicken the
heart and to excite doubts even in the least inquisitive
minds. Thus when <i>S</i>rîmatî’s young husband
arrived at the conclusion that stones could not be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>gods (nay, in their hideousness, not even symbols
of the Godhead), he took refuge in the Vedânta as
preached by Keshub Chunder Sen. This was a
bold step. But when he told his young wife what
had happened to him, and explained to her his
reasons, serious as the consequences of such a step
were in India, she, as a faithful and devoted wife,
at once followed his example. Even then their
creed was indeed very simple. It was not pure
Vedânta, it was rather devotional Vedânta-Bhakti,
a belief in a phenomenal and personal God, not yet
in the Godhead that lends substance and reality to
all individual beings, whether gods or men. They
held that God was one, without a second, that He
existed in the beginning and created the universe.
They believed Him to be intelligent, infinite, benevolent,
eternal, governor of the universe, all-knowing,
all-powerful, the refuge of all, devoid of parts, immutable,
self-existent, and beyond all comparison.
They also believed that in worshipping Him, and
Him alone, they could obtain the highest good in
this life and in the next, and that true worship consisted
in loving Him and doing His will. There
is not much heresy, it would seem, in such a simple
creed, but to adopt it meant for the young husband
and his wife degradation and complete social isolation.
They might easily have kept up an appearance
of orthodoxy, while holding in their hearts those
simple, pure, and enlightened convictions. The
temptation was great, but they resisted. The families
to which she and her husband belonged occupied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>a highly respected position in Hindu society, which
in India is fortunately quite compatible with extreme
poverty. Much as both she and her husband had
been loved and respected before, they were now
despised, avoided, excommunicated. Even the allowance
which they had received from their family was
ordered to be reduced to a minimum, and in order
to fit himself to earn an independent livelihood, the
husband had to enter as a student in one of the
Government colleges, while his little wife had to
look after their small household. Soon there came
a new trial. Her husband’s father, who had renounced
his son when he joined Keshub Chunder
Sen’s church, died broken-hearted, and the duty of
performing the funeral rites (<i>S</i>râddha) fell on his
son. To neglect to perform these rites is considered
something awful, because it is supposed to
deprive the departed of all hope of eternal life.
The son was quite ready to perform all that was
essential in such rites, but he declared that he would
never take part in any of the usual idolatrous ceremonies.
In spite of the prayers of his relatives and
the protestations of the whole village, he would not
yield. He fled the very night that the funeral
ceremony was to take place, accompanied again by
no one except his brave little wife. Thereupon
his father’s brothers stopped all allowances due to
him, and he was left with eight rupees per month
to support his wife and mother. <i>S</i>rîmatî however
managed, with this small pittance, to maintain not
only herself and her husband but her husband’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>mother also, who had become insane, his little sister,
and a nurse. Under these changed circumstances
her husband found it impossible to continue his
career at the Presidency College, and had to migrate
to Dacca to prosecute his studies there. Here they
all lived together again, and though they were
sometimes almost starving, <i>S</i>rîmatî considered these
years the happiest of her life. She herself tried
to perfect her education by attending an Adult
Female School, and so rapid was her progress, that
on one occasion she was chosen to read an address
to Lord Northbrook when he visited the school at
Dacca.</p>

<p class='c006'>The rest of their lives was not very eventful.
The husband, after a time, secured a small income;
but their life was always a struggle. <i>S</i>rîmatî, blessed
with healthy children, thought that she had all that her
heart desired, though she deeply felt the unkindness
of their relatives. Her servants loved her and would
never leave her, and when her husband complained
of certain irregularities in the household and thought
she was too lenient to her maids, she would but
sigh and say: “Why should I lose patience, and
thereby my peace of mind? Is it not better that
I should suffer a little by their conduct than that
they should be unhappy?” Her love of her children
was most ardent. Yet her highest desire was always
the happiness of her husband. She twined round
him, as her friends used to say, like a creeper, but
it was often the creeper that had to give strength
to him and uphold him in his many trials and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>unfulfilled aspirations. Religion was the never-failing
support for both of them, and their conversation
constantly turned on the unseen life here and
hereafter. The life which they lived together may
seem to us uneventful, uninteresting, unsatisfying; but
it was not so to them. This quiet couple, breathing
the keen, wholesome air of poverty, and drinking
from the well of homely life, performing their daily
round of duty in the village which had been the home
of their ancestors, were happy and perfectly satisfied
with their lot on earth. When at last the wife’s
health began to fail, young and happy as she was,
she was quite willing to go. She complained but
little on her sick-bed, and her only fear was lest she
might disturb her husband’s slumber and deprive
him of the rest which was so necessary for him.
She watched and prayed, and when the end came
she looked at him whom she had loved from her
early childhood, and quietly murmured: “O, All-merciful”
(Dayâmaya), and passed away.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus she lived and died: a true child-wife, pure
as a child, devoted as a wife, and always yearning
for that Spirit whom she had sought for, if, haply,
she might feel after Him and find Him. And surely
He was not far from her, nor she from Him!</p>

our own home as well as in a forest. <i>S</i>iva is here looked upon as
the symbol of the Supreme Spirit.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c006'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. Brâhma is the same as Brâhmo; the former Sanskrit, the latter
Bengali. Thus, Debendranâth called his book on the Upanishads
“Brâhma-dharma<i>h</i>,” though Brâhma also is a faulty name in
Sanskrit.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c006'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. Râmtonoo is probably meant for Râmatanu, body of Râma,
but when a name has once become familiar in its modern Bengali
form, I do not always like to put it back into its classical Sanskrit
form.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c006'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. A full account of this Saint is to be found in a book lately
published by me, “Râmak<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a, his Life and Sayings,” by
F. M. M., 1898.</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f12'>
<p class='c006'><a href='#r12'>12</a>. Sandhyâ is derived from Sandhi, literally the joining, the
coming together of day and night, or night and day. Sandhivelâ
is twilight, and Sandhyâ has the same meaning. Sandhyâvandana
was originally the twilight-worship, the morning and
evening prayer, to which a third was added (the Mâdhyâhnika) the
noon prayer, when the sun culminated. These prayers were once
incumbent on every Brâhman, though they have now assumed
a very perfunctory form, or are omitted altogether.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f13'>
<p class='c006'><a href='#r13'>13</a>. I still have a letter from the late M. Bergaigne, in which he
asks when my Index would be published, and adds: “<span lang="fr">Je m’étais
décidé  pendant ces vacances à  écrire tout le Rig-Véda sur des
fiches, et à me composer ainsi un index qui pût me permettre des
essais d’interprétation indépendante. Je suis arrivé  à la moitié  de
ce travail, et grâce à la rapidité  que je suis parvenu à atteindre, et
aussi à une grande puissance de travail, je puis le terminer en moins
d’un mois&#160;... S’il n’était pas trop exiger, je vous prierais de me
dire aussi si vous citez tous les emplois de chaque mot <i>sans aucune
exception</i>, ou si vous êtes départi de cette rigueur pour les mots
très usuels, et enfin si vous adoptez l’ordre alphabétique pur et
simple.</span>” I could answer all these questions in the affirmative.</p>

The fire, when lighted on the hearth, was supposed to bring the
